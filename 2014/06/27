If i type a

16:35 < anex> look at waht ive done
16:35 < anex> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqXr-DZ4ZSc
16:35 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Hi, welcome to join #deepin
16:35  * ManateeLazyCat Let me see.
16:36 < anex> only thing thats changed is i moved from comoiz-ubuntu to deepin-compiz
16:36 < anex> casue of the compatibility
16:36 < anex> hi
16:36  * s991533 15:21 < anex> I installed deepin desktop 2 and can someone help me understand why gtk-decortor is loading and not emerald? i made pkgbuild of emerald to work with deepin-compix pakage and it loads when i type run command "emerald --replace" but of couse wont  set on reboot, in ccsm i have under window decorator emerald --replace and set to load in gsettings and "decor is a plug set to load and has the emerald --replace under it, with a no go,

16:38 < anex> im on arch linux by the way
16:38 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Emerald has better effective, but emerald has bug that compiz' Alt+Tab will add window titlebar by emerald .
16:38 <@s991533> arch is cool, but difficult
16:38 < anex> yea i built my own emerald package for deepin-compiz
16:39 <@ManateeLazyCat> We will drop compiz next version, instead we own window manager for better performance, compiz is very bad for VMs and real-machine.
16:39 < anex> it works if i do a run command of "emerald --replace
16:39 < anex> but on reboot no effective
16:39 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: you build emerald with deb package ?
16:39 < anex> do you have a recommendation to set it
16:39 < anex> na
16:40 < anex> let me see the source 1 sec
16:41 < anex> git://anongit.compiz.org/fusion/decorators/emerald#branch=compiz++
16:42 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We will release Deepin 2014 in 2014-07-06, too short to change, but we will test and will consider use emerald instead gtk-decortor in next version.
16:45 < anex> any work around till now? any way i can help? im developing this for manjaro linux http://manjaro.org/ any way we could help you so you can benefit for your hard work
16:46 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Now, all developer focus on fixed bug of Deepin 2014 for release final version.
16:46 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We will start new Window manager after 2014-07-06
16:48 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We perhaps will user mutter bulid new window manager.
16:50 < anex> im just trying to figure if there is something superseding the emerald --replace like for example the control center, also typing dos not work in the control center for keyboard short cuts for example and and the power buton doesnt tke it to the logout screen, is there something ii missed on that that it need to call? the lock feature works eith it but not power button in control center
16:50 < anex> also the icon changer does not expand
16:51 < anex> all packages built from git on the 25th
16:52 < anex> also what power manager are you using? it wont change in control center
16:52 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Because compiz has build-in keystroke support, we use some feature of compiz.
16:52 < anex> yea i know that but actual typing into the conrtol center does not work
16:52 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We use golang build all desktop-environment module in /usr/lib/deepin-daemon
16:53 < anex> oh go
16:53 < anex> go-2:1.3-1 this?
16:53 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: All backend module bulid by golang, frontend build by qml/python
16:54 < anex> kk
16:54 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: It's fast to hacking if you know golang, qml and python.
16:54 < anex> kk
16:54 < anex> im learning but no expert
16:56 < anex> i like your DE just no fan of ubuntu
16:59 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We use golang build backend, desktop/launcher/dock use html5 as frontend, dde-control-center use qml as frontendm
17:00 < anex> the compiz-ubuntu package worked alright before and loaded the actul gtk window border theme the only issue was minimizing windows that are not docked the icon would dissapear, adn when you minimize a docked app and try to open it again it would load another instance of it so bad intergaration with dock but that was it. but everything else was great
17:01 < anex> anyway you can have the gtk window border like that?
17:02 < anex> in my vidow it shows it it looks real nice please just have a peek and tell me what you think if you have a min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqXr-DZ4ZSc
17:08 < anex> that was a system load test really
17:08 < anex> faired pretty good
17:08 < anex> lots of stuff open
17:14 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We even want make gtk-decortor build-in new window manager.
17:15 < anex> oh ya
17:15 <@ManateeLazyCat> s991533: Are you there ?
17:17 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We will build new file-manager, driver-center, window-manager in next version.
17:19 < anex> thats all good, and i will be building all this for arch distribution packages etc.. but for now could you help me on replacing the gtk decorator or?
17:20 < anex> it just look funky lol
17:20 < anex> no one likes it
17:21 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We have froze feature to make Deepin 2014 stable.
17:21 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: https://github.com/fasheng/arch-deepin this is developer of Deepin build it.
17:21 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: It's include all of Deepin module.
17:21 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: fasheng is also arch-linux developer. ;)
17:22 < anex> oh cool that just came out
17:22 < anex> didnt know of that
17:22 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Are you arch-linux expert ?
17:22 < anex> not expert i know my fair share
17:23 < anex> oh just looked at the page further
17:23 < anex> ive known of that
17:23 < anex> the repo
17:23 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We're looking for system developer to help use build Deepin repo, we will build Deepin repo to base on Debian in next version.
17:24 < anex> repos are ease why i maintain arch repos
17:24 < anex> system is different though
17:24 < anex> but was a ubuntu and debian user first
17:25 < anex> you need help building packages for it or?
17:34 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We need build packages.
17:34 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We will build high-quality application in my Deepin repo.
17:35 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We know which application that Chinese poeple's like, but don't know people's like in other country.
17:35 < anex> i do
17:35 < anex> im in america
17:35 < anex> most our users are from america, south amarica, and euro
17:36 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Are you interested help us invete new user in IRC ?
17:36 < anex> i know which of the gtk are best, which qt are best
17:36 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We want more people in america can use Deepin to help them life eaiser and happier.
17:36 < anex> i noticed your apps are qt
17:37 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: In 2011 ~ 2012, most of Deepin application is build on gtk+/deepin-ui
17:37 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: After then we use new technology, such as qt5 and webkit/html5
17:37 < anex> yea i seen that
17:37 < anex> qt 5 is where its at
17:39 < anex> in my opinion and from what ive seen alot of people are wanting and expecting a move to qt from gtk and not use ann gtk based apps at all in the near future ive already seen it start to happen in my distro
17:40 < anex> we have all the desktop environments and the one thats the least download is gnome
17:41 < anex> for example i maintain mate and people are threating to leave if we build it on gtk 3 when mate moves to it soon
17:42 < anex> but all up to preferance
17:43 < anex> best thing i think is to drop gtk in my opinion
17:44 < anex> one of themain things people are complaining about to is client side decorations
17:45  * ManateeLazyCat Restart my Emacs for english completion.
17:45 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We not just want maintain old DE, we want build new DE and deepin-apps for bulid new user experience.
17:46 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Deepin's aim is build new design OS to change linux community.
17:46 < anex> yeea of course start off what pople use most like file manager, compression utilities, text editors, image viewers, etc
17:47 < anex> get your base first ten can start to do more
17:47 < anex> and just so you know
17:47 < anex> some people compare deepin to bloat
17:48 < anex> not me jsut heard it more then once
17:49 < anex> people want the full featured experience with no cpu otr ram usage but that when you gotta make decisions on what to have and what to cut, liek what is to much and what is to little, you know?
17:51 <@ManateeLazyCat> We not just build easy to use deepin-apps, we also build developer tools, such as Deepin-Emacs ( https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-emacs )
17:51  * ManateeLazyCat http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AndyStewart is my Emacs homepage.
17:52 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Deepin 2014 use 500mb memory when start, still have much improve for memory optimization.
17:53 < anex> na i noticed it was pretty good
17:54 < anex> RAM: 2371MB / 7946MB
17:54 < anex> thats what mine says
17:55 < anex> firefox, hexchat, terminal, muci player, package manger is whats open
17:55 < anex> music player*
17:56 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: English is better. english not use fcitx input method, Deepin just use 350MB memory.
17:57  * ManateeLazyCat s/English/English version/ 
17:58 < anex> look      http://imgur.com/sQLpoey
17:59 <@ManateeLazyCat> Ah, i just use Emacs.

18:04 < anex> dde-session-daemon is using 125 MB
18:05 < anex> dde-launcher is using 50 MB
18:06 < anex> deepin_menu/main.py is using 50 MB
18:07 < anex> dde-dock-applets is using 50 MB
18:07 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We will decrease memory usage of deepin-menu in feature.
18:07 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: We have details of memory usage, you don't need paste it. ;)
18:07 < anex> lol ok

23:35 <@ManateeLazyCat> anex: Hi
23:36 < anex> hiya
23:37  * ManateeLazyCat Write some code of Deepin screenshot v3 with qml technology.
23:43 < anex> i was doing some playing around with compiz-ubuntu and everything works right expect the dock. when you minimize a application it hides then click the icon again to mazimize and it opens another instance of the application
23:43 < anex> expect = except
23:46 < anex> i just put back on deepin-compiz
23:47 < anex> i just wanted to play with the other some to see the differance
23:48 < anex> there is only one thing wrong with the control panel. I installed a update like an hour ago.  you cant type in the control panel at all like for example the keyboard shortcuts
23:48 < anex> do you know about that issue?
23:49 < anex> its been there
