01:49 < zyw> 这里有人么
14:02 < eMBee> good afternoon
14:02  * eMBee 's booted the live usb with english, but wantschinese input
14:36 <@s991533> eMBee: then install some input method
14:39 < eMBee> ok, i would have expected that already be installed by default
14:39 < eMBee> since it is a live image with also supports chinese if i choose it at boot, so input method should already be there
