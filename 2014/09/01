15:34 < albert_> Hi
15:35 < albert_> Is there a way to change the dpi scaling
15:35 < deepin_bot> yo xD
15:35 < albert_> after installing the nvidia drivers everything is big
15:40 < fasheng> you mean screen resolution or dpi?
15:40 < deepin_bot> hi , How do you do?
15:43 < albert_> Hello
15:43 < deepin_bot> hello , How do you do?
15:43 < albert_> Hi
15:43 < deepin_bot> hello ?
15:43 < albert_> Hello?
15:43 < fasheng> if you want to change the screen resolution, display module in deepin control center is what you are finding
15:43 < deepin_bot> Welcome ;)
15:43 < albert_> fasheng I don't meant to change the resolution
15:43 < albert_> the display scaling is what I mean
15:44 < albert_> DPI
15:44 < fasheng> OK, I see... Let me have a look...
15:44 < albert_> the resolution is my monitor's native resolution, but title bars are too big
15:48 < fasheng> well, I'm afraid you have to run xrandr command manually, just like this: xrandr --dpi 144
15:48 < fasheng> more information to see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg#Display_size_and_DPI

20:57 < rydhwan> hello all
20:57 < deepin_bot> hi ;)
20:58 < rydhwan> after install login is refused cause pass is wrong ?
21:00 < rydhwan> fresh install and  fresh password
21:00 < rydhwan> any idea
21:03 < fasheng> maybe is a terrible issue, but you could just switch to tty by pressing ctrl+alt+f1. And login, you could enter desktop through `startx startdde`

21:37 < fasheng> sudo ln -svf /usr/sbin/lightdm-gtk-greeter /usr/bin/lightdm-deepin-greeter
