00:16 < Fernandos> Wow that DE is soo awesome!!
00:17 < Fernandos> going home now, cu later! will need some help reducing the graphics effects to a minimum
01:02 <@s991533> .tell Fernandos hi, which version are you using?
01:02 < deepin_bot> s991533: I'll pass that on when Fernandos is around.
01:06 < brainy> Hi all xD
01:06 < deepin_bot> hi ~
01:11 <@s991533> brainy: hi
01:36 <@s991533> Fernandos hi
01:38 <@s991533> hi Fernandos
01:39 < deepin_bot> hey (y)
01:48 < Fernandos> hi s991533 :)
01:48 < deepin_bot> Fernandos: 2014-11-28 - 17:02:35 <s991533> tell Fernandos hi, which version are you using?
01:48 < deepin_bot> Welcome xD
01:49 < Fernandos> heh, I forgot starting dhcpd and I wondered why many, but not all links were broken :D
01:49 < brainy> hi Fernandos
01:50 < deepin_bot> Hi xD
01:50 < brainy> Fernandos, do you install via network?
01:50 < Fernandos> Version: 20141125.b8337cf-0
01:51 < Fernandos> I've installed via the arch repos :)
01:51 < brainy> Ah ok
01:51 < Fernandos> So far I'm more than happy with it, except that things are quite slow due to heavy desktop effects
01:52 < brainy> Yeah that's my impression too
01:52 < brainy> I used only in Virtualbox but it seemed heavy.
01:53 < Fernandos> It seems that just nobody knows about deepin. I'm missing an "engineer-mode", which strips down all fancy and uses a tiling windows manager by default. That would make it very attractive for 90% of my arch friends.
01:53 < brainy> I will stick with version 12.06 for now.
01:53 < brainy> It's 2 years old but still fine for me.
01:54 < brainy> Fernandos, hmmm I see what you mean.
01:54 < Fernandos> The only reason seemingly all my friends use i3, is because they enjoy the keyboard and tiling window manager and low-footprint.
01:55 < brainy> i3 looks very minimal xD
01:55 < Fernandos> imho, that can easily be achieved with deepin too. just falling back to a thin scriptable panel in engineer-mode and abstracting away the search of the fullscreen menu to a keybinding would do it.
01:57 < Fernandos> I'm not sure if all control-panel settings are available through a library, but if that's the case, someone could writean  ncurses or similar cli gui.
01:58 < brainy> Fernandos, is it not possible to replace the default WM of deepin with something else?
01:58 < Fernandos> s991533: Can you please help me disabling some or all desktop effects?
01:59 < Fernandos> brainy: idk. have used deeping the first time now. Have to read it's docs and API.
01:59 < brainy> Fernandos, ok :D
01:59 < Fernandos> s991533: I'm not sure, but I'm willing to contribute to deeping. Am a dev/sysadmin and graphics designer. I know that's a rare combination, but it exists :)
02:01 <@s991533> Fernandos: hmmm ... I'm happy to help, but I have something important to do, I'll work with windows untill 2015
02:02 <@s991533> Fernandos: but don't worry, there will be a deepin staff here
02:02 <@s991533> Fernandos: Her name is Cathy, she'll be here from Mon to Friday
02:03 <@s991533> Fernandos: or maybe some other users have help you too
02:03 <@s991533> Fernandos: but if you have some gereral problems about debian based linux, I can help you easier, I am fimilar with it
02:04 < Fernandos> s991533: No worries, I'm not a linux fanatic. I actually work with osx,linux and windows if neccessary. Whatever is required to do the job. However I'm using linux about 15years now.
02:05 <@s991533> Fernandos: great, I believe that you are a guru
02:05 < Fernandos> And freebsd, but less with solaris altough I often work on a sun cluster.
02:05 < brainy> Fernandos, nice. Me too but I must say I still don't know many things about Linux.
02:05 <@s991533> me too
02:05 <@s991533> I just need to use windows now, something important
02:06 <@s991533> so I won't use Linux for maybe 1 ~ 2 month
02:06 <@s991533> Fernandos: which distro is your favorite?
02:06 < Fernandos> I guess deepin is using compiz, otherwise it must have implemented it's own effects engine ontop or into a composition manager. Will have to find out, if it's even configurable, or if I need to patch it.
02:07 < Fernandos> s991533: hmm.. favorite for what kind of usage?
02:07 <@s991533> Fernandos: I think you are right, I remember it's compiz
02:07 < Fernandos> s991533: I used slackware, switched to gentoo and now I'm on arch. I like the latter. But my favorite is nixos and freebsd, simply as that.
02:07 <@s991533> Fernandos: as a desktop?
02:08 <@s991533> wow
02:08 <@s991533> you are really a geek
02:08 < deepin_bot> yo !
02:08 <@s991533> it'll spend much time on setting up these distros
02:09 < Fernandos> not with nixos. You only do that once. Then you have your configuration file which can be used for any other machine. It's easily deployable and everything is atomic and reproducable.
02:10 < Fernandos> So basically set that nixos desktop up in a VM, tweak and configure it whenever you've time and when you think it's perfect. You just copy that configuration file and use it for the real setup onto the metal.
02:10 < Fernandos> http://nixos.org
02:10 < deepin_bot> [ NixOS Linux ] - nixos.org
02:11 < brainy> Do you guys do regular backups of your installations with clonezilla? I love that tool !
02:11 < brainy> So many things can go wrong with Linux :D
02:13 < Fernandos> I use rsync :) 1:1 bit cloning isn't 100% reliable. I haven't used it, but I believe that http://relax-and-recover.org/ is a good solution.
02:13 < deepin_bot> [ Relax-and-Recover - Linux Disaster Recovery ] - relax-and-recover.org
02:14 < Fernandos> Anyways, if you've got zfs, then you'll have less issues with backups ;)
02:14 < brainy> Fernandos, thanks I'll have a look.
02:15 <@s991533> brainy: hey, it's made in Taiwan
02:15 < brainy> s991533, that's true lol
02:15 <@s991533> brainy: I know them, I also use DRBL
02:15 <@s991533> Fernandos: thanks for your info
02:15 <@s991533> Fernandos: I'll try it next year
02:15 <@s991533> brainy: I have their T-shirt, haha
02:16 < brainy> s991533, lol nice
02:17 <@s991533> Steven is the team leader
02:17 < brainy> s991533, it's a very good project! :-)
02:17 <@s991533> I invited him to give us a speech at my school before
02:17 <@s991533> brainy: yeah, they also have other coll projects
02:18 <@s991533> like DRBL, ezilla
02:18 < brainy> Nice :-))
02:18 < brainy> Fernandos, I'll have a look at rsync now.
02:19 < Fernandos> backintime is a nice gui, if you need it.
02:19 < brainy> Thank you Fernandos
02:19 <@s991533> I use rsync and clonezilla
02:20 < brainy> s991533, why both? It's better?
02:20 <@s991533> brainy: no no
02:21 <@s991533> brainy: for different usage
02:21 <@s991533> clonezilla for the OS
02:21 <@s991533> rsync for data only
02:21 <@s991533> clonezilla also helps me backup windows
02:21 < brainy> s991533, Ah, okay :D
02:22 < Fernandos> I never need to have copied of the OS, therefore I only use rsync. And if I have to deploy an OS, I usually have images and configuration management. (ansible,vagrant)
02:22 < Fernandos> have to take a look at lxc, but imho it's inferior to bsd jails
02:22 < deepin_bot> XD
02:23 < brainy> cu later all xD
02:23 < Fernandos> It takes me 15min to install the os. I never delete /home so, I've instantly all original settings.
02:24 < Fernandos> s/copied/copies/g
02:24 < deepin_bot> Fernandos meant to say: I never need to have copies of the OS, therefore I only use rsync. And if I have to deploy an OS, I usually have images and configuration management. (ansible,vagrant)
02:24 < Fernandos> awesome bot!
02:27 < Fernandos> Ok, deepin-compiz is a fork of compiz. Need to figure if and how I can conifgure the effects. Didn't find infos in the chiese wiki on that.
02:38 < Fernandos> hmm not sure if they fixed ccsm breaking deepin, hope they fork ccsm. http://www.linuxdeepin.com/forum/8/23223?&hilit=compiz+effects

02:42 <@s991533> I'm not sure
02:46 <@s991533> gtg
02:46 < deepin_bot> have a nice day  :)
02:46 <@s991533> seeya
02:46 < deepin_bot> see ya :D
03:35 < brainy> Hi xD
03:35 < deepin_bot> hello ~
03:47 < brainy> hi arun_ xD
03:47 < deepin_bot> hello :P
03:48 < arun_> hi brainy how are u ?
03:48 < deepin_bot> yo  :)
03:48 < arun_> u deepin_bot deepin_bot deepin_bot  hi, don't know who cursed u
03:54 < brainy> arun_, lol
03:54 < brainy> I'm fine thanks xD
06:55 < brainy> Hi deepin_bot
06:55 < deepin_bot> Hello brainy!
06:55 < deepin_bot> hello :D
06:55 < brainy> xD
06:55 < deepin_bot> haha
15:22 < zswnic> 什么时候出深谈呢
15:22 < zswnic> 用这个聊天不太方便
16:19 <@s991533> hello all
16:19 < deepin_bot> hey  :)
17:10 < T1960CT> Hello, I'm trying to install deepin 2013 with a USB key and it's giving me error -110
17:10 < deepin_bot> hi (y)
17:11 < T1960CT> How do I boot from USB?
17:14 < arun_> T1960CT: how did u create the USB Bootable?
17:15 <@s991533> T1960CT: what's the error message?
17:15 < T1960CT> I used Linux Live USB creator, LiLi has never given me any problems before, and the error message is -110, I'll get the full code, hold on
17:16 < T1960CT> The error is: USB 1-1: device not accepting address x, error -110
17:17 < T1960CT> where x is it trying from 2 to 5
17:17 < T1960CT> and then it finishes with hub 1-0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 1
17:17 < T1960CT> I've tried multiple ports
17:19 < T1960CT> Just tried with a new key, new port, same problem
17:20 < T1960CT> Trying now with Unetbootin
17:23 < T1960CT> Trying now with YUMI
17:25 < arun_> T1960CT: try with Unetbootin shouldn't give a problem, hey can u check ur md5sum of that iso ??
17:25 < arun_> the iso may be corrupt as well
17:27 < T1960CT> The ISO boots to the GRUB menu with no problems and I've used it in Virtualbox without any problems, Unetbootin did not show an option to boot from Deepin only to "try to install it" and it did not do anything.
17:28 < T1960CT> arun_: What's the MD5 for the original ISO?
17:28 < T1960CT> I'm getting: cf52d9f2ef6ef8c3415e06ed4e9ecc51
17:31 <@s991533> T1960CT: check it out on the website
17:31 <@s991533> T1960CT: dd is another choice to creat live usb
17:32 < T1960CT> I'm on windows at the moment, dd seems to be linux terminal only, right?
17:33 < T1960CT> MD5 matches
17:37 < brainy> hi T1960CT
17:37 < deepin_bot> hi !
17:37 < T1960CT> Hello
17:37 < deepin_bot> yo :-D
17:39 < T1960CT> How are you, brainy?
17:40 < brainy> I'm good thanks xD
17:40 < brainy> Are you using virtualbox inside your Windows, T1960CT ?
17:41 < T1960CT> To install Deepin? No, I'm trying to install it on my laptop.
17:41 < brainy> Ah!
17:42 < brainy> For me the installation program stops after a while :-(
17:42 < brainy> Can't get it to work.
17:43 < T1960CT> Sorry 'bout that.
17:43 < brainy> T1960CT, welcome back xD
17:43 < T1960CT> Thanks
17:44 < brainy> How much RAM does your laptop have, T1960CT ?
17:44 < T1960CT> 4GB
17:44 < brainy> Ok!
17:45 < brainy> That should be enough I think xD
17:45 < T1960CT> It suggests 1GB for Deepin 2013, 2GB being comfortable, I think 4 will be good :D
17:46 < brainy> Yea :D
17:47 < T1960CT> So any ideas as to what could be causing this?
17:52 < arun_> due, use UNetbootin and make sure u have 1st boot as usb in ur BIOS setting..
17:53 < T1960CT> I do. I've used Linux many a time, Deepin is the only distro to give me this problem.
17:56 <@s991533> T1960CT: yes, if you are using windows now, I think UltraISO is also a great tool to do this
18:00 < T1960CT> s991533: Giving it a shot now
18:01 < arun_> s991533: best I have used is YUMI
