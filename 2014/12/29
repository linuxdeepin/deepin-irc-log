00:02 <@s991533> no problem
01:05 <@s991533> fg
02:47 < frecel> s991533: did you guys develop your own dock from scratch or is this a fork of another project?
02:47 <@s991533> frecel: never
07:31 < arun> hi all
07:31 < arun> s991533:
16:20 < dardevelin> out of curiosity what is the mission statement of «deepin»
16:20 < dardevelin> s991533, ^
16:23 <@s991533> dardevelin: ?
16:24 < dardevelin> s991533, sorry, I mean, I know there is the distro and that there is a company
16:24 <@s991533> hmmmm.
16:25 < dardevelin> I know that the company 'sells services' related to linux and deployment, but I know nothing about 'for the distro' what is the intended vision
16:25 < dardevelin> example ubuntu wants to be a desktop OS, while they also have support and services for services.
16:26 < dardevelin> redhat wants to have servers and fedora branch does research on 'workstation' machines
16:26 < dardevelin> were there is minimal get out of the way tool for the business apps.
16:27 < dardevelin> OpenSuse wants to be a place where companies can come together without exposing their 'particular' business but still contribute back and get features from the community
16:27 < dardevelin> debian wants to be a universal operating system, pretty much make a soup of all that is out there in a consistent manner
16:27 < dardevelin> as for deepin, i have nothing :/
16:28 < dardevelin> what is the vision/goal
16:28 < dardevelin> s/services for services/services for servers/g
16:29 < dardevelin> s991533, _
16:30 <@s991533> deepin is for all the non-geek user
16:30 <@s991533> make linux easier for them
16:32 < dardevelin> sorry I do have to ask, is this the vision of deepin the company as well, or the community ?
16:32 < dardevelin> is there any roadmap somewhere ? as someone wanting to contribute, how could one 'say, see what needs doing'
16:33  * dardevelin apologizes for his broken english
16:36 < dardevelin> s991533, ^
16:37 <@s991533> there is a company working on deepin
16:37 <@s991533> you can contribute on github or gitcafe
16:37 <@s991533> raodmap is not public for now, will be public in future
16:38 < dardevelin> s991533, what is the 'official stance' of the company on 'free software/open source'
16:39 < dardevelin> some companies think it 'matters as technical decision' other think is more of an ideological/moral decision
16:39 < dardevelin> I mean, is 'deepin' committed in always _reverting_ to FOSS or some potential lock on segments/sections/all ?
16:42 <@s991533> I'm not sure ...
16:42 <@s991533> dardevelin: you can ask hualet, he is a official developer of deepin
16:43 < dardevelin> s991533, my apologies, I have only spoken to you as I feel (from observation) you tend to be the most active in IRC
16:43 < dardevelin> s991533, so are you a contributor as well, just a follower/member/user ?
16:43 <@s991533> kind of contributor, also user
16:44 < dardevelin> hualet, whenever you are available, i would appreciate if you said something. Thanks in advance
17:24 <@s991533> hi hualet 
17:24 <@s991533> are you there?
17:24 < hualet> hi, s991533 yeah
17:25 <@s991533> dardevelin: is looking for you :)
17:25 <@s991533> hualet: dardevelin is looking for you :)
17:25 < dardevelin> hualet, hi
17:25 < hualet> just left for a moment ;)
17:25 < dardevelin> indeed I am.
17:25 < dardevelin> s991533, told you are one of 'the deepin company' developers
17:26 < hualet> dardevelin: yeah, I just saw your chat
17:26 < dardevelin> and I am looking to understand a little bit more on how the company wants to have the project playing out. from a mission statement to process. yeah
17:26 <@s991533> -> Wuhan Deepin Technology Co.,Ltd.
17:29 < dardevelin> s991533, i got that info from the site and even checked the company's registry
17:29 < hualet> dardevelin: we are a company that devoted to build a Linux Distro that every common people can use easily, but the service that we provide will be targeting the government or some companies like that
17:31 < dardevelin> as for a roadmap and how one can lets say as a contributor come to 'influence' the path. are there any provisions on how it could happen ?
17:31 < dardevelin> hualet, ^
17:31 < dardevelin> by the way I will take a couple minutes to reply, got a phone call. sorry.
17:36 < hualet> dardevelin: the problem is that we are really out of lack of staff, so there's a lag building the community, indeed
17:37 < hualet> dardevelin: you a developer?
17:45 <@s991533> hualet: I guess so
17:47 < hualet> s991533: so he wants to contribute to out projects, right?
17:48 <@s991533> hualet: yeah
18:01 <@s991533> ping dardevelin @@
18:01 < hualet> dardevelin: I'm off work and going home now, glade that you want to contribute, you can reach me at mr.asianwang@gmail.com if you need, bye ;)
18:37 < dardevelin> back
18:38 < dardevelin> oh sorry. had to take care of that client
19:04 <@s991533> dardevelin: where are you from?
19:06 < dardevelin> s991533, I am Portuguese.
19:06 < dardevelin> You ?
19:07 <@s991533> dardevelin: Taiwan
19:13 < dardevelin> ;)
19:26 <@s991533> dardevelin: I'll respectfully suggest you and your team start from here: https://www.transifex.com/organization/linuxdeepin
19:28 <@s991533> the fast way, and can surely make a better user experience for Portuguese users
19:29 < dardevelin> s991533, I know that. the idea behind the work group is the following
19:29 < dardevelin> distributions lack man power
19:29 < dardevelin> and have their goals and visions.
19:30 <@s991533> okay, I got your point
19:30 <@s991533> what do you think about Deepin?
19:31 < dardevelin> we as advanced users, tend to have our own priorities. so we will try to _from within the group_ improve our experience while we think the side effect will be the distro will improve.
19:31 < dardevelin> translation is definitely a thing we intend to do. but again, it needs to part from the group work. as we do work for each others and submit upstream
19:31 < dardevelin> we are still evaluating which distribution we will contribute too
19:31 < dardevelin> hence all the questions we have been making
19:32 < dardevelin> also we are not all from the same country, so yes, improving portuguese is definitely something I can do but not necessarily something we all can do.
19:32 < dardevelin> most of us are developers.
19:33 < dardevelin> s991533, deepin so far seems to have an elegant UI and seems to be creating something (visually different) from the other distros. That is in itself interesting, however we have to evaluate the rest as it will play a major role when deciding
19:34 <@s991533> sounds interesting
19:40 < dardevelin> :)
19:41 <@s991533> dardevelin: do you have a github account?
19:41 <@s991533> or your group
19:41 <@s991533> I am interested to see the projects you are helping
19:43 < dardevelin> s991533, this particular group is only starting out. my github account is not the best representative of my contributions. and the group itself is fairly new
19:43 < dardevelin> but go ahead and have a look at https://github.com/dardevelin
19:43 <@s991533> dardevelin: thanks
19:43 < dardevelin> we will establish an organization in github when we decide on a distro
19:43 <@s991533> good
19:44 <@s991533> how many people are in your group?
19:44 < dardevelin> so far about 4
19:46 < dardevelin> some people have 'strict' criteria for the distro selection
19:46 < hualet> hi dardevelin, s991533 ;)
19:46 < dardevelin> hualet, heyia, welcome back
19:46 < hualet> dardevelin: what about you ?
19:47 < dardevelin> I am back. sorry for taking some time when I told you i had a call
19:47 < dardevelin> had to answer a client.
19:47 < hualet> dardevelin: never mind ;)
19:48 < hualet> dardevelin: so I heard that you want to contribute to our project?
19:48 <@s991533> ih hualet 
19:48 <@s991533> dardevelin: so how do you know each others? classmate?
19:49 < dardevelin> s991533, as an example: https://github.com/dardevelin/Go-For-It this is an app where you only see a single commit of my own
19:49 < dardevelin> when I am more like 'his mentor'
19:49 < dardevelin> at least on those technologies
19:49 <@s991533> hmmmm ...
19:50 < dardevelin> s991533, common interest. ever heard of jupiterbroadcasting ?
19:50 <@s991533> no
19:50 < dardevelin> difficult to be classmates (being all from different countries) :)
19:50 < dardevelin> http://jupiterbroadcasting.com/
19:55 <@s991533> haha xD
19:55 < hualet> dardevelin: a fan of elementry OS?
19:55 < dardevelin> hualet, who ?
19:56 < hualet> the author of Go-For-It
19:56 < dardevelin> hualet, yes and no. he likes things that look good and and is the OS he uses at the moment. thus made the app in such a away that integrates well with it
19:57 < dardevelin> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnw556C9FZQ
19:57 < dardevelin> well the video is on the home page, so I assume you have already seen it
19:58 < hualet> dardevelin: It looks cool, and I'm a bit fond of it ;)
19:59 < dardevelin> hualet, why is deepin creating it's own thing instead of 'combining efforts' ?
19:59 < dardevelin> need to have control or wanting something really different ?
20:02 < hualet> dardevelin: you know, some of the open source communities are not very kind, we used to summit some bugs to them, but they refused to fix them
20:02 < dardevelin> hualet, I see.
20:02 < dardevelin> did they provided reasoning on why they wouldn't ?
20:03 < dardevelin> have you guys tried to submit bug reports ?
20:03 < hualet> and yes, sometimes we need more control to achieve some very difficult goals ;)
20:03 < dardevelin> makes sense
20:03 < dardevelin> sorry
20:03 < dardevelin> i meant submit code*
20:04 < dardevelin> not bug reports. sometimes I think something and type another ... muscle memory
20:04 < hualet> dardevelin: haha, it's OK
20:04 < hualet> some of us did
20:05 < dardevelin> I see.
20:06 < hualet> dardevelin: do you participate open source projects much?
20:06 < dardevelin> not as much as id like
20:07 < hualet> ;)
20:09 < dardevelin> id love to do it full time. but not always possible
20:10 < dardevelin> are you also from taiwan ?
20:10 < dardevelin> hualet, ^
20:11 < hualet> dardevelin: nope,  China mainland ;)
20:11 < dardevelin> ah
20:11 < dardevelin> :)
20:12 < hualet> what? ;)
20:12 < dardevelin> just acknowledgement
20:12 < dardevelin> as understood
20:15 < hualet> dardevelin: English is your mother tongue?
20:16 < dardevelin> no. portuguese is. english is second. spanish, italian and french are just elementary level
20:16 < hualet> wow, you mean you speak all these languages?
20:17 <@s991533> cool
20:17 <@s991533> hey hualet, I just saw gmail been blocked in mainland china, do you use it via vpn? haha
20:18 <@s991533> cause you leave your gmail, not deepin's mail address
20:19 < dardevelin> I speak portuguese and english. I can understand and scratch some spanish and italian. french is really hard for me to construct sentences of my own
20:19 < dardevelin> however the later 3 I can read them fairly decently
20:19 < dardevelin> I am fluent in pt and en though
20:20 < hualet> s991533: every programmer need a vpn account to survive...
20:20 <@s991533> hualet: xDDDD
20:20 < hualet> s991533: it's essential ;)
20:20 < dardevelin> hualet, is the company yours or you just work for the company ?
20:21 <@s991533> yeah, you are right
20:21 <@s991533> dardevelin: not his, haha
20:21 < dardevelin> if selling to gov is the intention how do you feel they will feel about foreign contributors ?
20:21 < hualet> dardevelin: of course not, I'm not than kind of guy who's able to rule many people ;)
20:22 < dardevelin> no harm intended. just trying to know your level of impact within the company
20:23 <@s991533> hualet: you may want to talk to manateelazycat
20:24 < hualet> dardevelin: np, since it's totally open source, so it's ok if there's foreign contributors
20:24 <@s991533> but he rarely comes here
20:24 < hualet> s991533: do you know manateelazycat?
20:25 <@s991533> yeah, your boss, right?
20:25 < hualet> s991533: he's too busy
20:25 <@s991533> very busy man
20:25 < hualet> yeah, my boss, but he's very kind and sometimes childish, haha
20:26 < hualet> s991533: I used to go to his home and watch some movies ;)
20:26 <@s991533> oh cool
20:27 < hualet> s991533: ever planned a travel here?
20:27 < hualet> sorry, to here...
20:27 <@s991533> no, not yet
20:28 <@s991533> been there before
20:28 <@s991533> once
20:28 < dardevelin> how many developers worn on deepin ? if I may know
20:28 <@s991533> work?
20:28 < dardevelin> yes. lol
20:28 < hualet> s991533: like here or not? ;)
20:29 <@s991533> hualet: I like it, haha
20:29 < dardevelin> s/worn/work/
20:29 < hualet> s991533: you lied XD
20:29 <@s991533> why not?
20:29 < hualet> dardevelin: about 100
20:29 <@s991533> Guilin is very beautiful
20:30 < hualet> s991533: I mean the GFW thing...
20:30 < dardevelin> that seems quite a large numbers of developers. or you mean some multiple task types
20:30 <@s991533> that's bad, china sucks!
20:32 < hualet> dardevelin: oh sorry, there's only about 20-30 developer out there
20:33 < dardevelin> ah
20:33 < dardevelin> alright. that makes more sense
20:33 < dardevelin> normally if you have 100devs
20:33 < dardevelin> you tend to have about more 15 people just in between
20:34 < dardevelin> that is why I was considering a large amount
20:36 < hualet> dardevelin: one or two months ago, we have only 10 devs at most in total
20:37 < hualet> dardevelin: do you use Deepin now?
20:38 < hualet> s991533: do you know Audrey Tang?
20:42 <@s991533> hualet: no
20:42 < dardevelin> hualet, not yet. wiped a hard drive to install and do some testing of my own and frecel did the same
20:43 < hualet> s991533: quit a fan of her ;)
20:44 < hualet> dardevelin: who's frecel?
20:44 < dardevelin> friend
20:45 < hualet> hummm...
20:46 < dardevelin> he was here earlier
20:50 <@s991533> hi cubarco 
20:50 < cubarco> hi again s991533!
21:12 <@s991533> how do you do cubarco 
21:15 < cubarco> not so well, I got stuck on my project
21:15 <@s991533> okay~
21:15 <@s991533> good luck
21:16 < cubarco> thx
21:20 <@s991533> :)

22:16 < hualet> sorry, song bin..lol
22:17 <@s991533> @@?
22:17 < brainy> hi hualet
22:17 < hualet> hi, brainy ;)
22:18 <@s991533> brainy: hualet is one of the official developers of deepin
22:19 <@s991533> you can share your thoughts to hime
22:19 < hualet> s991533: he's a colleague of mine, song bin's a nickname for him
22:20 < hualet> s991533: I mean iyzsong
22:20 < hualet> brainy: so do you get any problems using deeeeepin?
22:21 < iyzsong> 0.0 ok
22:27 < brainy> nice to meet you hualet  :)
22:28 < hualet> brainy: hummm, nice to meet you too :)
22:28 < brainy> hualet, Yes, unfortunately Deepin 2014 doesn't work after installation, I only get an empty desktop :-(
22:28 < brainy> No icons etc. the keys or mouse also don't work, I can see only a wallpaper :(
22:29 < brainy> I want to share my opionions but I can't use it. Right now I am using Deepin 12.06
22:29 < brainy> (It's very good! ;)
22:29 <@s991533> brainy: all the 2014 or just 2014.2 RC? I remembered that you can not use 2014.2 RC
22:29 < brainy> s991533, all of them
22:30 < hualet> brainy: have you tried to reboot your machine?
22:30 < brainy> Yep, didn't work.
22:31 < brainy> Anyway I will try again today.........
22:31 < hualet> brainy: did you installed it as VMs or...?
22:33 < brainy> hualet, with VM it works, but on normal machine it doesn't ;(
22:33 < brainy> by the way, deepin is the best! ;)
22:35 < brainy> Actually I can't remember if I tried a reboot after install, so I might try again.
22:35 < hualet> brainy: It shouldn't be, the common case is that deepin sucks in VMs...
22:35 < brainy> hualet, that's strange then
22:36 < hualet> brainy: well, maybe you should try it first...
22:37 < brainy> Ok thank you hualet
22:39 < hualet> brainy: you are welcome ;)
23:34 < brainy> s991533, how many people were at the Deepin meeting and was there any food? :)
