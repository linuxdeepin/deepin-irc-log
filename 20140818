18:04 < wakou>  <wakou2> deepin_bot: shut up
18:04 <@s991533> because too few people here
18:05 < wakou> Cathy-Deepin: Are you a mod/admin or a dev on deepin project?
18:06 < Cathy-Deepin> Yes, I am.
18:08 < wakou> Cathy-Deepin: did you read the log from yesterday? I tried to use deepin, I had no luck at all..
18:08 < Cathy-Deepin> I'm off duty now.
18:08 < Cathy-Deepin> Let's call it a day.
18:09 < Cathy-Deepin> See you tomorrow.
18:09 < Cathy-Deepin> I'll quit.
18:09 < Cathy-Deepin> Bye-bye.
18:43 < wakou> .commands
18:43 < deepin_bot> wakou: I am sending you a private message of all my commands!
19:47 < wakou> deepin_bot: help tell
19:47 < deepin_bot> wakou: Give someone a message the next time they're seen
19:47 < deepin_bot> e.g. Willie, tell Embolalia he broke something again.
19:51 < wakou> tell Cathy-Deepin I tried to join the forum. Di not get activation code. Asked three times, no email sent, no code received. Advice on forum is "contact board admin". But can't because not a member!
20:29 < wakou> Succeeded by starting complete new member, had to use a new email. Then found that community in Eng is at linuxquestions. So whole thing was a waste of time.
20:31 < wakou> .tell Cathy-Deepin  Succeeded by starting complete new member, had to use a new email. Then found that community in Eng is at linuxquestions. So whole thing was a waste of time.
20:31 < deepin_bot> wakou: I'll pass that on when Cathy-Deepin is around.
20:31 < wakou> ps admin..
20:32 < wakou> s991533 Bot example is wrong, please correct it! ^^ example says this "deepin_bot> e.g. Willie, tell Embolalia he broke something again."
20:33 < wakou> s991533: Which does not work, missing the leading dot should be ".tell <name> foobar etc etc"
22:22 < deepin> Woo!
22:23 < deepin> Got it to wor, using unetbootin. need to add nomodeset and disable splash.
22:24 < deepin> (was wakou) now running live from USB
