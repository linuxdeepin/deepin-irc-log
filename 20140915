10:09 < boom016>   yes  how do i update deepin
17:50 < WIE> 0.0
17:51 < WIE> cool
18:38 < ubuxubu> when i boot deepin in my VMware VM, it will go to full screen on my display monitor? when i do the same with ubuntu it will go to full screen? why is deeping limited to a small display size in VM?
18:39 < ubuxubu> i meant it will NOT do full screen*
18:42 < ubuxubu> this seems like a very advanced OS far more developed than most i have tried
