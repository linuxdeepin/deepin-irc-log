01:59 < Guest88730> not much activity here
02:26 < SergioAD> Hello
02:27 < SergioAD> I am a new Deepin 2014 user, I have used Deepin 2012 - 2013.2 and my favorite one was the Deepin 2013.X series
02:28 < SergioAD> so you can imagine that my favorite desktop layout was the Windows like one
02:29 < SergioAD> I am using it on 2014.2 RC thanks by adding it back as an alternative desktop
02:29 < SergioAD> but I have three questions
02:30 < SergioAD> 1.- why GNOME 3.8 instead of the 3.12 - 3.14?
02:31 < SergioAD> 2.- why the Ubuntu base? why not a Fedora / openSUSE tumbleweed / Manjaro / Debian base?
02:33 < SergioAD> 3.- why your GTK 2 theme is quite diferent to the GTK 3 one?
02:34 < SergioAD> these are my general questions
02:35 < SergioAD> oh a fourt one, wich Ubuntu version are you using?
02:35 < SergioAD> the LTS?
02:43 < SergioAD> finally a fift (pardon me by the last two) why you dropped WPS as your default office suite?
06:33 < SergioAD> Hello
08:04 < niugao> 请问有人知道， deepin2014.2 啥时候发布么？？
08:04 < niugao> 正式版
13:47 < frecel> s991533: what is your dock called? I'm trying to find the source for it on github
14:09 < hualet> hi s991533, still there, huh? ;)
14:14 < frecel> hualet: are you using Deepin?
14:14 < hualet> frecel: yeah, of course ;)
14:15 < frecel> hualet: would you recommend it?
14:16 < hualet> definitely yes ;)
14:17 < frecel> hualet: do you live in china? It looks to me like this os is mostly meant from people in China and Taiwan
14:19 < hualet> frecel: yeah, I'm Chinese. but the os's not meant to target only Chinese and Taiwanese
14:20 < hualet> frecel: where are you from ?
14:20 < frecel> hualet: Canada
14:21 < hualet> frecel: do you know that Deepin's from China?
14:22 < frecel> hualet: It's kind of hard to miss that fact :D
14:22 < frecel> hualet: if you browse the wiki most pages are in chinese
14:23 < hualet> there's much internationalization and localization work to be done for Deepin, indeed
14:24 < hualet> frecel: yeah ;)
14:26 < frecel> hualet: I'm considering switchin to deepin for the project that I'm trying to make
14:26 < frecel> hualet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Eqpkec3ey236dEEWRNFWLZfRBdsfXLs2rBbeXlGN7E/edit?usp=sharing
14:29 < hualet> frecel: I didn't get it
14:30 < frecel> hualet: basically the project is to form a group of people who will all use a single Linux distro and help improve it
14:30 < frecel> hualet: but the priority is to help people in the group
14:31 < hualet> frecel: that's great! the Deepin community needs your help ;)
14:31 < frecel> hualet: yea, I'm just having a hard time talking people into joining
14:31 < hualet> how many people do you get? or it's just a plan for now?
14:33 < hualet> frecel: send a mail to chenxiangbang@linuxdeepin.com, he's the manager of the forum of Deepin, maybe he'll help ;)
14:33 < frecel> hualet: for now it's just me and one other guy
14:34 < frecel> hualet: the problem is that a lot of people don't want to move away from their favourite distro or even desktop environment
14:36 < hualet> frecel: that's indeed a problem
14:37 < frecel> hualet: that's why I figured we should get a group of people and then vote on which operating system we should use, I would vote for Deepin
14:38 < frecel> hualet: are you a Deepin developer or just a user?
14:38 < hualet> I'm a developer of Deepin, for now, I'm in charge of the DMovie project ;)
14:39 < frecel> hualet: do you work for Wuhan or are you just a community dev if you dont mind me asking?
14:40 < hualet> frecel: I think you should probably join the Deepin community and help the people there
14:41 < hualet> frecel: working at WuHan
14:45 < frecel> hualet: I like what you guys do, I'm downloading deepin now and I will install it on my laptop today
14:46 < frecel> hualet: how does deepin handle multiple monitor setups? I have two screens and I find that a lot of linux distros have a problem with that
14:49 < hualet> frecel: I don't use two screens very often, but I tried for about 2-3 times, no problem, you can try it yourself XD
