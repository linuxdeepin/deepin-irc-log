01:45 < arunpyasi> hi brainy
01:49 < brainy> arunpyasi, are you using MATE desktop?
01:49 < arunpyasi> brainy: naaa, I am running XFCE
01:50 < brainy> There is something weird arunpyasi
01:50 < arunpyasi> brainy: what happened?
01:51 < brainy> Mouse settings by default were ok, but then I tried to change them just to see the difference, and now I can't get them back to default again.
01:51 < brainy> If I set to "default", it's not like they were in the beginning (after fresh install)
01:51 < brainy> hhmmmmmm
01:52 < brainy> I shouldn't have touched
01:54 < brainy> Never change a running mouse!
01:54 < brainy> :-)
01:56 < brainy> arunpyasi, I have to reinstall my Linux just to get the mouse settings back loool
