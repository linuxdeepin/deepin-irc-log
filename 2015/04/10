01:57 < dadix> hi
02:48 < arunpyasi> how are u dadix
03:57 < dadix> I am fain
03:57 < dadix> I am on Osgrid
03:57 < dadix> arunpyasi
03:58 < arunpyasi> dadix: ohh ok
03:58 < dadix> and you ?
03:58 < arunpyasi> dadix: I am quite busy today... will catch you later.. I just installed my new Distro
03:58 < arunpyasi> I installed Deepin dadix
03:58 < arunpyasi> and its working cool :D
03:58 < dadix> :)
03:59 < dadix> welkome , than
18:53 < vodkode_> Heya everyone
18:54 < brainy> hi vodkode_
18:55 < vodkode_> hi brainy how are you?
18:55 < brainy> vodkode_: good thanks, how are you?
18:55 < vodkode_> I just installed linux deepin 2014, first time checking it out, extremely impressed with it so far
18:55 < brainy> vodkode_: people here are usually asleep xD
18:55 < vodkode_> I'm good
18:55 < brainy> I like Deepin too
18:55 < brainy> great OS
18:56 < vodkode_> I come from a background of using debian mostly and lately linuxmint
18:57 < vodkode_> the only issue I've had with deepin so far - and it is a very minor issue - is that I've had to add some repos and apt-get some stuff, I also installed a pack I downloaded, one isn't showing in the app list, the other is but has no icon
18:57 < vodkode_> any ideas?
18:58 < brainy> hmmmm
18:59 < brainy> That is weird, usually the installed packages should be visible in the menu
18:59 < vodkode_> yeah very weird
18:59 < brainy> or you mean in the list of the deepin software manager?
18:59 < vodkode_> no, the menu
19:00 < brainy> ok yep
19:00 < brainy> Which package did you install if I may ask?
19:00 < vodkode_> the weird part isn't (to me) so much that, but that I can change the icon, but add to the dock and the icon is gone or in ones case its changed
19:00 < vodkode_> weird to have an app in the dock sans icon
19:00 < vodkode_> plume creator and hotshots
19:01 < vodkode_> plume is a writing app I use (I am a writer of sorts) and hotshots is my favorite screenshot app
19:01 < brainy> Okay
19:02 < brainy> Sometimes some of the Deepin developers are online here, you could try to ask them
19:03 < vodkode_> well, I am still thoroughly impressed, probably the most professional distro I've ever seen
19:03 < vodkode_> they did a killer job on the UI/UX
19:03 < brainy> :D
19:03 < brainy> As I said, I love it oo
19:03 < brainy> too*
19:04 < brainy> It feels like a real Desktop OS
21:54 < brainy> hi hualet bro
21:55 < hualet>  brainy, hi
21:56 < hualet> what will you spend you weekend?
21:56 < hualet> sorry, what will you do to spend you weekend ? brainy
21:57 < brainy> hualet: Nothing special actually
21:57 < brainy> hualet: Are you going to a Linux party?
21:59 < brainy> hualet: After I install all the Windows 7 Updates, now the OS is slow as hell
21:59 < brainy> It's a joke
22:00 < hualet> brainy: nope, there isn't much linux party here in Wuhan, it's not a city like Beijing or Shanghai
22:00 < brainy> hualet: ah I see, I think Shanghai is a nice city
22:02 < hualet__> brainy,  did I miss something ? just switched to ubuntu
22:03 < hualet__> there's too much problems on my Mac after I upgraded to OS X 10.10.3
22:03 < brainy> hualet: Not much, I only said: "After I install all the Windows 7 Updates, now the OS is slow as hell. It's a joke"
22:04 < brainy> And: " ah I see, I think Shanghai is a nice city"
22:04 < brainy> hualet: whats the problem with the new OS X?
22:06 < brainy> hualet__
22:06 < hualet__> brainy,  the screen can not be waken up after a long time sleep
22:06 < brainy> hualet__: oops, so you have to restart?
22:06 < hualet__> the network connection get disconnected now and then
22:07 < hualet__> brainy, I have to ssh into my Mac from my phone and reboot it EVERYDAY
22:07 < hualet__> that just drive me crazy >_<
22:07 < brainy> hualet__: That's crazy.
22:08 < brainy> hualet__: I think you must use Deepin, it's better xD
22:08 < hualet__> brainy, good call ;)
22:08 < hualet__> brainy, have you tried LXQT?
22:10 < brainy> hualet__: No I haven't
22:10 < hualet__> the successor of LXDE
22:10 < brainy> hualet__: LXDE is good for speed, but I don't like the look.
22:10 < brainy> hualet__: I prefer MATE Desktop
22:11 < hualet__> brainy, ok, but LXQT looks good
22:11 < brainy> hualet__: I might give it a try, if it is available for Ubuntu
22:12 < hualet__> brainy, If my memory serves well, the DE's not completed yet
22:13 < hualet__> but It can work
22:14 < brainy> hualet__: OK
22:14 < hualet__> s991533,  ping ；）
22:14 < brainy> xDD
22:14 < brainy> s991533 seems so busy these days
22:15 < brainy> hualet__: Look at all the people here, they connect everyday but they never say a word xD
22:15 < brainy> And when I say "hi" to them, they say "what?"
22:15 < brainy> lool
22:17 < hualet__> brainy, people don't want to be bothered while they are in slient mode, lol
22:17 < brainy> hualet__: xDD
22:28 <@s991533> hualet__: yeah
22:28 <@s991533> very busy
22:28 <@s991533> try to figure our git-lfs
22:29 <@s991533> do you know that?
22:29 < hualet__> s991533, I know it's something new
22:29 < hualet__> Large File Storage, right?
22:29 <@s991533> hualet__: Yeah, I really need that
22:29 <@s991533> to pull out something from repo
22:30 < hualet__> s991533, what do you expect from it?
22:30 <@s991533> pull out some static files from repo
22:31 <@s991533> hualet__: https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs
22:31 <@s991533> as you can see
22:31 <@s991533> there are too many files here
22:32 < hualet__> let me dig it up
22:32 <@s991533> 57386 directories, 727777 files
22:32 <@s991533>  11,475 commits
22:32 <@s991533> not the latest result, ha
22:33 <@s991533> make the process with git become very slow
22:35 < hualet__> s991533, I don't think it will solve your problem
22:38 <@s991533> hualet__: I am jut trying
22:38 <@s991533> I hope it can
22:38 <@s991533> why not?
22:52 < hualet__> s991533, AFAIK it just prevents big network traffic caused by some tiny modifications to large files
22:53 < hualet__> but your situation is that you have too much files
22:53 <@s991533> hualet__: Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.
22:53 <@s991533> I think replace them with pointers may help
22:54 < hualet__> s991533, I don't doubt that XD
22:55 <@s991533> hualet__: so what's the point you think it won't help?
22:56 < hualet__> s991533, anyway, how to use that feature? do you know that?
22:56 <@s991533> hualet__: I'm working on it
22:56 <@s991533> it's too young, so a little bit hard
22:57 <@s991533> and I'm not sure if it even slower the git work process ...
22:59 < hualet__> s991533, you can try it, but don't expect much
22:59 <@s991533> I'm trying now
22:59 <@s991533> for many hours
22:59 <@s991533> from last night
23:00 <@s991533> our repo is too large ha
23:00 <@s991533> I tried with smaller repo
23:00 < brainy> 727777 files, wow
23:00 <@s991533> but the progress on the repo I need to work on, very slow
23:01 <@s991533> brainy: do you write in golang?
23:01 < brainy> s991533: No, sorry.
23:02 <@s991533> brainy: ha, no problem, neither do I
23:02 < hualet__> s991533, your bottle neck is that there are too many files in you repo
23:02 < hualet__> XD
23:02 <@s991533> hualet__: yeah, I want to move them out ...
23:03 < hualet__> s991533, what do you mean? move them out? to where?
23:03 < hualet__> the storage service provided by GitHub?
23:05 <@s991533> hualet__: the lfs
23:05 <@s991533> treat them like non-source code
23:06 <@s991533> hualet__: according to this page https://git-lfs.github.com/ I think it'll help
23:06 <@s991533> oh yeah, the first push with the main repo finally started!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
23:10 < hualet__> s991533, ok, please let me know if you have some good news to share ;)
23:10 <@s991533> yeah I will
23:10 <@s991533> it spent me so much time ha
23:11 <@s991533> hualet__: what about deepin
23:11 <@s991533> do you have some news?
