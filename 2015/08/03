00:02 < arunpyasi> hi metak
00:02 < arunpyasi> Mitchell92: hi
00:02 < arunpyasi> s991533: hi
00:02 < Mitchell92> Hello
00:02 < arunpyasi> why this channel low traffic these days :(
00:02 < arunpyasi> Mitchell92: how are you ?
00:02 < metak> hello
00:02 < arunpyasi> vodkode: hello
00:02 < arunpyasi> metak: hi man how are you ?
00:03 < arunpyasi> where did s991533 go ??
00:03 < arunpyasi> dantmnf: hello :D
00:03 < Mitchell92> I'm fine, thanks...
00:03 < metak> I'm fine... just updating some arch-deepin packages... you? ;-)
00:04 < arunpyasi> Guys, I need help !!!! where is the option to create a hotspot/broadcast hostspot ?
00:04 < arunpyasi> Mitchell92: cool
00:04 < Mitchell92> Are you saying you want to create an ADHOC network?
00:04 < arunpyasi> metak: well, I am finally gonna develop next release of Chitwanix !
00:04 < arunpyasi> Mitchell92: yup !
00:04 < arunpyasi> I didn't see an option in my deepin desktop environment :P
00:05 < Mitchell92> I have never used deepin, I came on this channel a few weeks ago to assist a buddy who needed some help. Deepin is based on Ubuntu, so if you were to look up how to do it on ubuntu, it should be similar or identical on deepin.
00:05 < Mitchell92> My primary computer is a MacBook Pro running the latest OS X... I have to say, as far as linux goes, I'm a big OpenSuse fan.
00:05 < arunpyasi> Mitchell92: cool
00:06 < arunpyasi> nope, there is no option in the desktop environment of deepin
00:06 < arunpyasi> I am not running gnome or other. I am running our lovely DDE
00:06 < Mitchell92> hmm... I am a gnome fan myself. One moment, let me see if I can find something for you.
00:06 < metak> arunpyasi: you're maintaining your own distro?
00:07 < Mitchell92> arunpyasi - http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-create-a-wireless-ad-hoc-network-in-ubuntu
00:07 < Mitchell92> or - https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/net-wireless-adhoc.html
00:09 < arunpyasi> metak: yeah, a small distro of mine.
00:10 < arunpyasi> Mitchell92: firstly, this app is not available in deepin
00:11 < arunpyasi> I think I need to install it but don't know the package name. BTW I think I shall follow ArchLinux's guide, that works in almost all the distros :D
00:12 < Mitchell92> Okay... Well, I really don't know. As I said, I am primarily a suse user... although I have been using Mac OS X mostly recently. I hope you work it all out.
00:16 < arunpyasi> Mitchell92: yeah. Thanks.
00:16 < arunpyasi> metak: you are developer in Deepin right ?
00:16 < metak> no
00:16 < metak> just an arch linux user
00:17 < metak> I'm looking at the website and it says you're using your own desktop environment?
00:19 < arunpyasi> metak: yeah kinda
00:19 < arunpyasi> metak: its named as Sagarmatha
00:20 < metak> so, what is it exactly?
00:20 < metak> fork of something?
00:21 < arunpyasi> metak: yup
00:21 < arunpyasi> metak: an incomplete fork of Cinnamon haha
00:21 < arunpyasi> I mean, its not maintained for a long logng time.
00:22 < metak> I can see that from git commits... heheh ;-)
00:22 < metak> why even fork it? that's so much extra work. It's crazy...
00:23 < arunpyasi> metak: yeah
00:24 < arunpyasi> metak: BTW, this project is aimed big
00:24 < arunpyasi> so, forked to create something new :D
00:24 < arunpyasi> metak: Its just that I didn't have much time to maintain
00:24 < arunpyasi> now, I will continue developing :D
00:25 < metak> okay...
00:35 < arunpyasi> Guess what! Adhoc not working haha
00:55 < metak> arunpyasi: http://jbradio.out.airtime.pro:8000/jbradio_a
00:58 < arunpyasi> metak: thanks. whats the talk about  ?
00:58 < arunpyasi> topic of today ?
00:59 < metak> don't know... they start llive show in a minute or two...
00:59 < metak> https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/
00:59 < arunpyasi> ohh OK
00:59 < metak> there's also video feed if you have decent connection
01:02 < metak> are you paid to develop your distribution arun?
01:02 < arunpyasi> metak: naa
01:03 < arunpyasi> metak: its not funded or supported by any organizations or anyone..
01:03 < metak> how do you manage to pull it off then? ;-) Isn't that too much work?
01:04 < arunpyasi> metak: yup, it is.
01:05 < metak> then why?
01:06 < arunpyasi> metak: cause there is no any Linux Distribution project alive in my country
01:06 < arunpyasi> So, I wanted to go for it.
01:07 < arunpyasi> So, the only active linux distribution project in my country is my distro. :D
01:07 < metak> heheh Nepal, right?
01:08 < arunpyasi> yup metak
01:08 < arunpyasi> Do you think its a bad idea?
01:11 < metak> not at all. IMHO I think it would be best to drop unneccessary forks like that (DE) and use whatever is possile from upstream without modifications... but that's just me.
01:12 < metak> what it's based upon? ubuntu LTS?
01:14 < arunpyasi> metak: they are unstable
01:14 < arunpyasi> they are obsolete now
01:15 < arunpyasi> Our next release will be 14.04 based.
01:16 < arunpyasi> so, what you do for earning metak ?
01:19 < metak> currently, looking for something... ;-)
01:20 < arunpyasi> metak: OK
01:20 < arunpyasi> so, where are you from metak ?
01:21 < metak> slovenia
01:21 < arunpyasi> vool
01:21 < arunpyasi> *cool
01:22 < metak> I have some free time and that's why I can play with packaging deepin desktop environment for arch... ;-)
01:23 < metak> why didn't you based your distro on deepin?
01:24 < arunpyasi> metak: cause I didn't knew about deepin hehe
01:25 < arunpyasi> metak: cool, I was wanting to ask you to maintain AUR4 for DDE hehe
01:25 < metak> i don't maintaint nothing deepin related in AUR4
01:26 < metak> just packages in my OBS project page and repository
01:26 < metak> fasheng updates those in AUR4
01:28 < arunpyasi> metak: OBS is your project??
01:28 < arunpyasi> Open Broadcast Software
01:28 < metak> no no

01:29 < arunpyasi> oh oh
01:29 < arunpyasi> OBS is a supercomputer right ?
01:30 < metak> it's openSUSE's build farm to build packages..
01:30 < metak> and it supports building packages for some other distros as well
01:30 < arunpyasi> metak: ahh, whats the name of the supercomputer that compiles stuffs in opensuse
01:30 < arunpyasi> I have heard of that supercomputer in #opensuse
01:31 < metak> you see here build machines https://build.opensuse.org/monitor
01:40 < arunpyasi> cool. Thanks.
01:42 < metak> if it weren't for that then there's no way in hell I could build all that on my super old P4... ;-)
