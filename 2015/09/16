20:43 < hualet> brainy: hmmm...just asked one of my colleague to build a bot to transfer messages here to our internal chatting tool
20:48 < brainy> hualet: is deepin-tgbridge the bot your friend built?
20:49 < hualet> brainy: I don't know who built that bot
20:49 < hualet> it's silly
20:50 < hualet> deepin-tgbridge: who are you
20:50 < brainy> hualet: :D
20:50 < hualet> deepin-tgbridge: who built you

20:55 < brainy> ok
20:55 < brainy> hualet: What's the advantages?
20:58 < hualet> brainy: Ubuntu suddenly removes its old repositories now and then
20:58 < hualet> Debian doesn't
