20:24 < arunpyasi> Ok bro
20:24 < brainy> ooohh
20:24 < brainy> Ok ay
20:25 < arunpyasi> brainy: I was searching you yesterday... regarding a hotel in Germany :D
20:25 < arunpyasi> cya bro.. be back soon
20:25 < brainy> oh sorry :D
20:25 < brainy> cu bro arunpyasi
21:56 < arunpyasi> hi brainy I am back :D
21:56 < arunpyasi> what are you doing today bro ?
21:57 < brainy> welcome back arunpyasi man
21:57 < arunpyasi> thanks bro :D what you doing ?
21:58 < brainy> arunpyasi: Today nothing special bro, Im just chilling :D
21:59 < brainy> arunpyasi bro, my PC became slow after I upgraded to Windows 10
21:59 < brainy> Do you have the same problem?
22:06 < arunpyasi> brainy: hehe, Bro, I don't use Windows :P
22:07 < arunpyasi> To be honest, I simply don't like M$ Windows much
22:07 < arunpyasi> And I suggest everyone to migrate or use Linux :D
22:09 < brainy> arunpyasi: I agree, but some software/hardware only work with Windows bro :(
22:09 < brainy> But Linux is much faster in my opinion
22:09 < brainy> Windows is bloated with so much unnecessary software
22:11 < arunpyasi> yeah brainy
22:11 < arunpyasi> which software/hardware you found not working with Linux
22:11 < arunpyasi> ?
22:11 < arunpyasi> If I could help you make it work or find an alternative, it would be cool :D
22:11 < brainy> arunpyasi: for me just a few programs, but I know many games making problems on Linux
22:12 < arunpyasi> ahh
22:12 < arunpyasi> if you go with gaming then I do agree with that
22:12 < brainy> :-(
22:12 < arunpyasi> What I recommend you is, if you have a good PC with high performance in Virtual Box, you can run windows there in VM and play games via it.
22:13 < brainy> arunpyasi: yeah
22:13 < arunpyasi> Else, you may setup multiboot to Windows with Linux and then use Linux most of your time while not playing :D
22:13 < brainy> thats my setup arunpyasi , but I prefer I could do everything with Linux :(
22:14 < brainy> Its nonsense to have to boot into windows just for some small task
22:14 < arunpyasi> ahh :D I agree !
22:14 < brainy> But for now I am happy with Linux for most of the things
22:14 < brainy> :-))
22:14 < arunpyasi> brainy: hey, you have been to Namaste hotel in Germany ?
22:14 < arunpyasi> :D
