03:52 < Deerclops> hi. the latest deepin upgrade wrecked my bootloader. is there anyone around who can help?
04:00 < Deerclops> After a recent upgrade my 14.04 LTS install has wrecked my bootloader. I'm trying to fix it using boot-repair liveCD but with little to no luck. I get these errors when trying to re-install the grub http://paste.ubuntu.com/12865735/ and http://paste2.org/3BX3NxyO
04:10 < Deerclops> Is there anyone actually here?

15:38 < felixonmars> fasheng: yeah that was a mistake :P fixed that locally, will update in next version
15:39 < felixonmars> fasheng: yes, peewee works now after hualet applied a fix: https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-movie/commits/release/2.3

17:18 < fasheng> felixonmars: the developer said deepin-movie 2.3 works well on Deepin 2015, I will reboot to Archlinux to test again...
18:53 < fasheng> hello, metak ^_^
18:53 < metak> hey ;-)
19:01 < metak> what's  up?
19:18 < fasheng> nothing, just happy to see you. btw, does the process of learning a new language well for you those days?
19:23 < metak> hmm, we'll see... i have other things to do, but I still plan on learning Japanese. ;-)
19:23 < metak> btw I removed a bunch of packages from arch-deepin repo...
19:33 < fasheng> yeah, looking forward you to show some Japanese to us, i think i could guess some of them :)
19:39 < metak> about deepin-nautilus-properties in arch-deepin repo... do you maybe already have pkgbuild file for it?
19:42 < fasheng> the code already sync to github yesterday, so just start to do it after debugging the deepin-movie
19:45 < metak> so this is forked nautilus?
19:47 < fasheng> yes, a fork of nauitlus, and only install one binary to /usr/bin/deepin-nautilus-properties. just a temporary solution for Deepin 2014
19:49 < metak> I see..
22:03 < choldrim> hello üòÅ
