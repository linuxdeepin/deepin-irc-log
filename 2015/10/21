06:18 < gsareon> Hello
06:19 < gsareon> I have a question, I'm currently on elementary OS and i'm wondering if i can install Deepin Desktop Environment but I couldn't find a repo. I'm on 12.04 Precise
07:58 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]:  gsareon: This maybe help u, http://wiki.deepin.org/index.php?title=%E6%B7%B1%E5%BA%A6%E6%A1%8C%E9%9D%A2%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83, but unfortunately, it has only Chinese version  ðŸ˜ž
08:13 < gsareon> It's okay, i realized there's no supported version, I only found Trusty DDE
08:13 < gsareon> thank you though
08:18 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]: u r welcome ðŸ˜Š
