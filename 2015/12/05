22:44 < brainy> hi hualet xD
22:44 < hualet> hi brainy
22:46 < hualet> I'm watching a documentary called Meru
22:58 < brainy> hualet: let me google it...
22:59 < brainy> hualet: It's about climbing?
22:59 < hualet> yes
23:00 < hualet> and I feel something in common with the climbers
23:01 < hualet> so I like the documentary and I suggest it to you brainy
23:01 < brainy> thank you hualet
23:01 < brainy> hualet: You trying to climb the Linux mountain with Deepin? :D
23:02 < brainy> Maybe there is a parallel
23:02 < hualet> haha, you get me, man
23:02 < brainy> lol
23:03 < hualet> but we're not that motivated as they are
23:03 < hualet> and don't push that hard as they do
23:04 < hualet> brainy: what do you mean by saying " maybe there's a parallel ?"
23:17 < brainy> hualet: I mean you are trying to climb something, but not a real mountain
23:17 < brainy> hualet: So it is similar, but not the same
23:17 < hualet> brainy: XD
23:17 < brainy> :D
23:26 < brainy> hualet: Have you ever been to Hong Kong?
23:26 < hualet> brainy: not yet, why?
23:28 < brainy> hualet: I was just curious :)
23:29 < brainy> Chinese culture is so rich
23:29 < brainy> I am very interested to learn
23:29 < hualet> brainy: I really want to go there, but I don't have much time :(
23:30 < brainy> hualet: I can understand :(
23:30 < hualet> brainy: yeah, that's the good part of being Chinese
23:32 < hualet> we have a long history XD
23:33 < brainy> yes :D
23:34 < hualet> you're interested in history, do you ? brainy
23:34 < brainy> yes hualet bro
23:34 < hualet> me too
23:35 < brainy> hualet: I have to go buy some food now, If I don't see you here later, then am I saying Good Night to you now :)
23:35 < hualet> it looks just so cool knowing every detail of how our history evolved
23:36 < brainy> agreed!
