20:30 < brainy> hualet_deepin, The website is not responsive :-(
20:32 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: isn't it RC?
20:38 < brainy> hi felixonmars , do you know if it's the final version?
20:38 < brainy> or not yet?
20:38 < felixonmars> not yet, if i understand correctly :P
20:39 < brainy> ok thanks felixonmars
20:40 < brainy> hi fasheng
20:40 < felixonmars> fasheng: i updated some changelog for you :P
20:42 < brainy> hi sbw, Deepin 15 will be released soon!
20:43 < brainy> We are all happy.
20:47 < fasheng> hi, brainy
20:49 < fasheng> felixonmars yes, i saw them. we could notify each other in that topic :)
20:56 < hualet_deepin> brainy: sorry, it's RC not the final version.
20:56 < brainy> ok hualet_deepin thanks :)
20:57 < hualet_deepin> and yes, the final release will be out soon
20:57 < hualet_deepin> hopefully next week :D
20:57 < brainy> it will be the best OS ever :-)
21:01 < hualet_deepin> brainy: thanks man
21:04 < felixonmars> :3
21:09 < hualet_deepin> I did mentioned that felixonmars is an arch user/packager, didn't I ? :P
21:10 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: ah, where did you mention :P
21:12 < hualet_deepin> before brainy said " deepin 15 will be the best OS ever", I think :D
21:15 < deepin-bot> [anonymous]:  It seems that Hexchat is broken, can send message out
21:15 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: didn't see your mention :(
21:17 < deepin-bot> [anonymous]:  felixonmars, can I invite you to our company after the final release of deepin 15 ?
21:19 < felixonmars> to get more Arch users? good
21:19  * felixonmars kidding
21:19 < hualet_deepin> haha, funny
21:21 < brainy> xD
22:11 < felixonmars> hualet, fasheng: one thing to discuzz: is it possible to remove unused and/or old tags of the deepin-mutter repo?
22:12 < felixonmars> because github api has some limits on tag api, and 286 tags is just too much...
22:12 < hualet> what ? 286 tags !!!
22:12 < felixonmars> this is the only repo that i cannot track automatically
22:12 < brainy> welcome hualet
22:13 < fasheng> i see, will clean up the upstream tags latter
22:13 < felixonmars> thank you :)
22:13 < hualet> hmmm...yo brainy :D
22:14 < hualet> felixonmars: there's limits on the tag counts ?
22:14 < felixonmars> this api can return 100 results per requesthttps://api.github.com/repos/linuxdeepin/deepin-mutter/tags?per_page=100
22:15 < felixonmars> and the real tags are not on the first page...
22:16 < hualet> so there's a limit on the per_page parameter, right ?
22:16 < felixonmars> yes
22:16 < hualet> I changed it to 300, no difference
22:16 < hualet> :D
22:17 < felixonmars> that's the limit i meant :P
22:17 < hualet> alright, I get it
22:17 < felixonmars> oh, i did missed another deepin-mutter update today x.x
22:18 < hualet> felixonmars: relax, man :D
22:19 < hualet> you don't care about deepin-metacity, right ?
22:19 < hualet> sonald fixed tons of bugs related to deepin-metacity today
22:20 < brainy> good job!
22:20 < felixonmars> i have bumped it, but it still crashes here
22:25 < felixonmars> FYI: https://github.com/fasheng/arch-deepin/issues/166
22:25 < hualet> we mostly focused on deepin-mutter recently, so there's some lag on bug fixing of deepin-metacity
22:25 < felixonmars> it's something related to nvidia driver though...
22:26 < felixonmars> kwin hangs X with the same nvidia driver
22:26 < felixonmars> but mutter just works magically fine
22:27 < hualet> I didn't see any error message related to Nvidia driver XD
22:28 < felixonmars> yeah, but no problem with open source drivers...
22:30 < hualet> ah...driver !!!
22:31 < hualet> drivers made me sick too much these days
22:31 < brainy> I need the nvidia driver :-(
22:31 < hualet> brainy: why ?
22:31 < brainy> hualet, it's faster bro
22:31 < brainy> better performance
22:32 < hualet> perhaps, but it breaks too often
22:33 < felixonmars> yay time to osu again.
22:33 < brainy> I hope Deepin 15 will be fine with nvidia hualet :-(
22:33 < felixonmars> before metacity crashes again...
22:36 < hualet> felixonmars: what's osu ?
22:37 < hualet> brainy: it will be fine, I think :D
22:37 < felixonmars> hualet: https://github.com/fasheng/arch-deepin/issues/165
22:38 < felixonmars> osu! is the game here: http://osu.ppy.sh/
22:39 < brainy> hualet, Will you osu too? xD
22:40 < hualet> nope, I don't even know what osu! is ! how old are you felixonmars if I may ask :/
22:40 < felixonmars> i'm 24 :/
22:42 < hualet> ah...the same age as mine
22:43 < felixonmars> and you thought i'm 12? :3
22:44 < hualet> that's pretty much what I was thinking since you mentioned you are playing the osu! game XD
22:45 < felixonmars> xD
22:48 < hualet> I'm curious about why there're so much ACG fans in this industry
22:49 < felixonmars> well, they share some similar requirements
22:49 < felixonmars> like open translation and write tools
22:50 < hualet> can you speak Japanese ?
22:50 < felixonmars> very limited
22:51 < hualet> I knew it
22:53 < felixonmars> and we arch devs even have a subtitle search engine for MLP https://ponytalk.foutrelis.com/
22:57 < hualet> how to express that I'm astonished :D
22:59 < brainy> I don't even know what you guys are talking about xD
22:59 < fasheng> felixonmars ok, all the upstream tags were removed in github/deepin-mutter, you could have a try again ~
22:59 < brainy> MLP, ACG, osu ...
22:59 < hualet> brainy: I don't know either XD
23:00 < brainy> hahaha
23:00 < felixonmars> yay works now http://i.imgur.com/wREcsga.png
23:00 < felixonmars> fasheng: thanks a lot!
23:00 < fasheng> :P
23:01 < hualet> felixonmars: your font looks ugly :P
23:02 < felixonmars> that's terminus 9
23:02 < felixonmars> i use it to display more text at once...
23:03 < hualet> let me check what's terminus...
23:03 < hualet> fasheng: how did you remove the tags ? manually ?
23:03 < felixonmars> http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/
23:07 < hualet> hmmm... it's really not my type
23:07 < brainy> the font looks very futuristic, not bad
23:07 < felixonmars> :P
23:08 < felixonmars> i actually use this font for all terminals and ides
23:08 < felixonmars> (for years)
23:14 < fasheng> hualet no, just several commands. but it's a little slow for each tag will takes about 10 seconds
23:14 < hualet> fasheng: great :D
23:32 < brainy> cu later all
