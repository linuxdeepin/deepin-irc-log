00:00 < hualet> haha ;)
00:00 < dardevelin> well I like everything. just depends on context and motive
00:00 < dardevelin> but often everything fascinate
00:00 < dardevelin> *fascinates me
00:00 < hualet> dardevelin: do you like history?
00:01 < dardevelin> yes. but not dates. I like events, epochs and the way it builds. often more interested in geopolitical implications of decisions through time
00:01 < hualet> I'm recently reading a book about the WWI and the WWII
00:01 < dardevelin> see I don't _read_ books per say
00:01 < dardevelin> i rarely read non technical books
00:02 < dardevelin> history is too often written by who ever won
00:02 < dardevelin> example a _war_ is defined as civil war if the state wins, or as revolution of the rebels win
00:02 < dardevelin> none describe who was right or actually how it played out.
00:03 < dardevelin> more often technology has been developed with a reason background and has some limitations context
00:03 < dardevelin> so by learning about technological steps you may learn more accurate history then by reading an historical book
00:03 < brainy> haha
00:04 < dardevelin> by looking at the actual _laws and documents_ that were passed you can learn more about the ideology, mentality and overall feeling of the population during a certain period/time then any other conventional book
00:04 < dardevelin> the best side of this approach is you get to learn a lot of technical concepts on multiple fields
00:05 < dardevelin> also reading the same subject in different languages tend to help. which with books tend to be difficult as a lot of them were already vetoed by publishers which may be or not influenced by political motivations
00:06 < brainy> btw s991533 happy new year! xD
00:06 < dardevelin> the bad side you take too long and often will miss _details_ but those often are offered in other means (like language)
00:07 < dardevelin> s991533, 新年快乐
00:07 < brainy> dardevelin, but it's still interesting to know what happened during WW1 and WW2 for example xD
00:08 <@s991533> dardevelin: happy new year :)
00:08 < dardevelin> Yes. in germany and a lot EU countries it is even illegal to have 'holocaust denial'
00:08 < hualet> dardevelin: hummm...that's a good point of view ;)
00:09 < dardevelin> brainy, if you learn about _army_ development impossible not to learn about WW . if you read how typical dishes came to be typical and how/why they were created
00:09 < dardevelin> you get to learn about the money and economical effects of the WW
00:10 < dardevelin> I also love to play the game of theory. I think about a group of facts. look at the commonly said, and try to _think in terms of actors(a country stance)_
00:11 < dardevelin> then try to create a group of hypothesis of actions that in a given context a certain country could have
00:12 < dardevelin> then I go and learn what actually happened. this often shows me how much I actually knew about the country by how much I was correct, and allows me to understand how their culture was built (in a way)
00:12 < dardevelin> this often gives me hints for other _future_ positions
00:12 < dardevelin> anyways. sorry for the rant
00:15 < hualet> dardevelin: not at all, that's interesting, and I agree the way you view things
00:16 < brainy> I still like to read about history xD
00:16 < hualet> dardevelin: it's just too hard to follow your thoughts and response ;)
00:17 < dardevelin> hualet, sometimes i get dragged and too flooded in many thoughts. I will try to be more concise
00:17 < dardevelin> that should help :)
00:17 < dardevelin> brainy, :) hearing by a good story teller is also great :)
00:18 < brainy> I think s991533 is already in full celebration mode haha
00:20 < hualet> brainy: maybe he's been asleep now ;)
00:21 <@s991533> no ...
00:21 <@s991533> working ...
00:21 <@s991533> haha ...
00:21 <@s991533> celebrate with my food ...
00:21 < brainy> lol
00:21 <@s991533> too busy this year, sad xD
00:22 <@s991533> never like this before
00:22 < hualet> speaking of food, do you Taiwanese eat sushi much?
00:23 < hualet> s991533: ^
00:24 < brainy> hualet, i asked him about typical taiwanese food just yesterday too haha
00:25 < hualet> brainy: yeah, I saw that, but he didn't answer yet
00:25 < brainy> lol yes
00:25 < hualet> brainy: and now we know that he's in _full_ working mode now, haha
00:26 < brainy> haha
00:34 <@s991533> hualet: yeah, I like it
00:37 < hualet> s991533: just like what I guessed...
00:37 < hualet> XD
00:37 < hualet> I'm going to bed, Good night guys and happy New  Year!
01:06 < brainy> bye hualet
01:08 < brainy> s991533, I will try to recover my Deepin 12.06 partition, I hope it will work
01:11 < brainy> be back later
01:38 < brainy> hi felixonmars
01:46 < brainy> wow Deepin has become very popular
01:46 < brainy> on distrowatch.com its now at 17th place
01:46 < brainy> When I first download it wasnt even in first 100
01:47 < brainy> or at least it was at the bottom of the list
01:51 < brainy> hi soixante
01:52 < brainy> in my opinion Linux needs more GUI-tools
01:53 < brainy> too much typing in console for trivial things
01:53 < brainy> console is sooo 1970
01:54 <@s991533> hi brainy 
01:55 <@s991533> xD
01:55 < brainy> hi s991533 lol
01:55 < brainy> I'm just talking to myself haha
01:56 <@s991533> I'll call our bot back soon :)
01:56 < brainy> :)
02:31 < brainy> hi all, brainy is back xD
02:36 <@s991533> hi brainy, I'm going to sleep, see you :)
02:38 < brainy> bye bye s991533
03:13 < Karbowiak> since either my google foo fails me, or it isn't mentioned anywhere, is 2014.2 based on Ubuntu 14.10 or 14.04? (or neither, if older version)
03:14 < Karbowiak> nevermind, my google foo failed me
03:14 < Karbowiak> /o\
08:45 < brainy> Happy New Year All !
08:48 < brainy> s991533, I did something funny
08:49 < brainy> I installed latest version of Linux Mint, and installed the theme of Deepin 12.06
08:49 < brainy> Now it looks like I have Deepin 12.06, but with the newest software haha
08:49 < brainy> This is great.
09:05 < kaer> ren bu duo
09:06 < kaer> 会说中文么？
09:08 < kaer> 我装的是deepin2014.2.rc   但是深度影院不能播放swf格式的视频   我该使用哪个软件？
14:29 < hdf> 大家新年好
14:31 <@s991533> Happy new year hdf 
15:54 < brainy> Hi all
16:03 <@s991533> hi brainy 
16:03 < brainy> hi s991533
16:03 < hualet> hi
16:04 < brainy> hi hualet happy new year all
16:05 < hualet> brainy: happy new year ;)
16:14 <@s991533> happy new year!
16:18 <@s991533> brainy: do you use google drive?
16:19 < brainy> s991533, no, sorry
16:20 <@s991533> brainy: okay, fine
16:22 < brainy> ;-(
16:31 <@s991533> I hate that google don't provide linux client
16:31 <@s991533> dropbox does, but too small, and I need to keep another account
16:32 <@s991533> thanks got there is a geek create a tool to mount googld drive via fuse
16:32 <@s991533> though it'll be slow, but acceptable
16:33 < brainy> How much space do you have on Google Driver, s991533 ?
16:33 < brainy> Drive*
16:35 <@s991533> 25 GB
16:35 <@s991533> 15GB is default, additional 10GB got from event
16:35 <@s991533> dropbox is 2GB ... xD
16:35 <@s991533> can get space via some events
16:40 < brainy> nic xD
16:40 < brainy> nice
16:53 <@s991533> hi dantmnf 
16:53 < hualet> s991533: don't you have the access to the online storage service provided by Baidu?
16:54 <@s991533> Baidu is very slow ... 
16:54 <@s991533> I think it's for the people in mainland china only ...
16:54 < hualet> s991533: Baidu's slower than Google ?
16:54 <@s991533> of course ...
16:55 <@s991533> you may not know
16:55 < hualet> can't imagine that, haha
16:55 <@s991533> but I believe that
16:55 <@s991533> your experience will be every different than people outside mainland china
16:55 <@s991533> the network environment in china is very strange
16:56 < hualet> s991533: yeah, you are right about that...
16:56 <@s991533> I wonder if I can get better performance via install official dirver from AMD for my graphic card, haha ...
16:57 <@s991533> amd radeon 7450
16:57 <@s991533> I usually don't install a driver
16:57 < brainy> s991533, you can try xD
16:58 < brainy> I installed the nvidia driver and now I have maximum performance xD
16:58 < brainy> It's so nice
16:58 <@s991533> brainy: yeah, for nvidia, I know
16:58 <@s991533> I'll try later
16:58 < brainy> ok
16:58 <@s991533> hope it won't break my linux
16:59 < hualet> brainy: can you still open Deepin Movie now?
16:59 <@s991533> I didn't try amd's driver before
16:59 < brainy> I didnt try hualet
16:59 < hualet> there are some cases that people can't open Deepin Movie after they installed the nvidia drivers
16:59 < brainy> s991533, whats the driver that your system is using right now?
17:00 < brainy> hualet, ahh I see
17:00 <@s991533> brainy: I didn't install additional driver, so it should came from kernel source tree I think
17:00 < brainy> hualet, I'm on Linux Mint right now, I will try later on Deepin
17:00 < brainy> ok s991533
17:00 <@s991533> brainy: oh I love Linux Mint xDDDD
17:01 < brainy> haha
17:01 < hualet> brainy: OK, and thanks for that ;)
17:01 <@s991533> though pidgin has bug on cinnamon
17:01 < hualet> I didn't even tried Linux Mint before...
17:01 <@s991533> hualet: try it!
17:01 <@s991533> hualet: you may like it
17:01 <@s991533> hualet: very easy for non-geek users
17:01 < brainy> It's a good distro for beginners, like Deepin
17:01 <@s991533> yeah
17:02 < hualet> ah, I love that...will download and try it later ;)
17:11 <@s991533> hualet: another important point, no offence, but they have not only cinnamon, but also mate desktop environment, which can runs very well on slow computer, deepin sometimes uses too much resources and make the computer slow, haha ...
17:11 <@s991533> which desktop environment are you using with linuxmint brainy ? 
17:12 <@s991533> I use mate for old computers and cinnonman for the computers have more memory
17:12 < hualet> s991533: that's what I'm already accomplished ;)
17:12 < brainy> s991533, Yes I'm using Mate even though I have a good computer haha
17:12 < brainy> I like the speed
17:13 < brainy> hualet, what part in Deepin do you develope?
17:15 < hualet> deepin-menu, deepin-notifications, deepin-movie
17:15 < brainy> wow nice xD
17:15 < brainy> I respect your work
17:16 < hualet> also participated in the older and the newer one of dde-control-center
17:16 < hualet> the older one's called deepin-system-settings ;)
17:16 < brainy> Yes I remember ;)
17:16 < hualet> brainy: thanks XD
17:16 < brainy> I was still using 12.06 until recently haha
17:17 < hualet> brainy: you did? I love that one toooooo :D
17:18 < hualet> btw, do you guys like the new icon set?
17:19 < brainy> it looks unique
17:20 < brainy> Is it different from 2014.1 ?
17:21 < brainy> Personally I prefer Faenza icons, but it's matter of taste.
17:22 < hualet> brainy: yeah, It's different from the one used in 2014.1
17:23 < hualet> leave for a moment, will be back ;)
17:57 < brainy> s991533, what is a favorite drink in Taiwan? :D
18:00 <@s991533> brainy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea
18:02 < brainy> haha that looks so nice!
18:20 <@s991533> (Y)
18:20 < brainy> what does that mean?
18:51 < brainy> hi metak
18:51 < metak> hello
18:51 < metak> happy new year... :-)
18:52 < brainy> happy new year you to :D
18:53 < metak> so, what's up?
18:53 < brainy> it's very quite here haha
18:54 < brainy> I installed Deepin 2014.2 yesterday
18:54 < brainy> have u tried it metak ?
18:55 < metak> nope, I'm a archlinux user... (I was yesterday in this channel, but with different nick... it was Communi... something ;-))
18:56 < metak> default setting in Communi irc client.. and I was too lazy to change it..
18:57 < metak> how is it?
18:58 < brainy> haha ok
18:59 < brainy> metak, well it has good and bad, It's very easy to use but it feels a bit slow
18:59 < brainy> at least thats my experience
18:59 < metak> html5...
19:01 < metak> since I've been porting DDE to archlinux I've managed to play a bit with it and it's also too slow for me... although my PC is more then a decade old... ;-)
19:08 < metak> overall, I just prefer Qt based applications... when I start DDE and launch nautilus for example, I just wanna kill myself... ;-)   it's a disgrace for a file manager...
19:08 < brainy> well it's true
19:11 < brainy> Now I remember you, you are the archlinux guy haha
19:11 < metak> LoL ;-)
19:12 < metak> brainy what are your PC specs?
19:14 < brainy> I have a 3 year old laptop
19:14 < brainy> I must look on the label, wait lol
19:14 < metak> no need...
19:14 < metak> I was just wondering
19:14 < brainy> 6 GB RAM
19:15 < brainy> Okay
19:15 < metak> that should be more than enough to run Deepin...
19:16 < brainy> Yes sure...it's not slow as in unusable...it's just the feel :D
19:16 < metak> yea I know...
19:16 < brainy> When I drag a window for example, I want it to feel fast
19:17 < brainy> Right now I have Linux Mint with Mate Desktop haha
19:17 < metak> I think it's combination of Compiz and Deepin ui tool that they use for some apps?
19:17 < brainy> is there a mate version for archlinux?
19:17 < brainy> Yes I think so too, metak
19:18 < metak> don't know if there is one... plenty of distros based on arch...
19:20 < metak> I'm on lxqt-git with kwin as a window manager... it's fast and stable!
19:20 < brainy> haha very nice
19:21 < metak> performance should improve when they move to Gala and dump Compiz... they should also dump than deepin-ui... it's just slow....
19:22 < brainy> hmmm do you think? But they put so much effort into it :(
19:25 < metak> yesterday, someone asked me in #jupiterbroadcasting (Linux Action Show) IRC if Deepin team is going to dump python and go with go+javascript... deepin-ui uses python as far as I remember...
19:25 < metak> it's slow...
19:30 < brainy> hmmmm I see
19:30 < brainy> so that's the problem
19:30 < metak> it's one of the problems...
19:31 <@s991533> brainy: it's a emotion
19:31 <@s991533> you can goole it xD
19:31 < brainy> haha ok s991533
19:31 < brainy> I already forgot my question haha
19:31 < brainy> I will take a nap now, see you later all :D
19:31 < metak> bye
19:36 <@s991533> hi metak 
19:36 <@s991533> never see you before
19:36 <@s991533> how do you do?
19:36 < metak> we talked yesterday... ;-)
19:36 < metak> I'm fine... happy new year!
19:39 <@s991533> metak: great, happy new year!
19:39 <@s991533> it's code here, haha
19:40 < metak> i had that default nick that comes with Communi irc client... cold?
19:42 <@s991533> oh, got it
19:42 <@s991533> yeah, I mean the weather
19:45 < metak> its cold over here too... i was cursing the Australians yesterday when I saw them celebrating new year in t-shirts on tv... ;-)  no fair!
19:49 <@s991533> ha ...
19:55 <@s991533> hi arun 
19:55 < arun> hi s991533
20:06 <@s991533> how did you celebrate for 2015 arun ?
20:10 <@s991533> hualet: does deepin provide downloading via bittorrent?
20:11 <@s991533> I mean the cd images
20:11 <@s991533> I think it'll help
20:12 < hualet> I don't know, I think they just decided that not to provide a BT link...
20:21 < metak> simple torrent with web seeds (sourceforge mirrors?) would provide a good download speed...
20:23 < hualet> metak: have you tried the BT link that Deepin provided for the previous versions downloads?
20:24 < hualet> they say its not that stable
20:24 < metak> no didn't tried it... why wouldn't it be stable?
20:24 < hualet> so they decided not to generate one this time
20:25 < hualet> metak: I don't know much about the details, just heard they discussed like that... XD
20:25 < metak> ok..
20:26 < metak> as far as I know, most distros suggest torrent first...
20:27 < hualet> metak: yeah, I agree...
20:54 <@s991533> hualet: same reason ... the seeding server should be outside ...
20:55 <@s991533> hualet: but it'll be better then download from official site
20:55 <@s991533> especially somebody finish downloading and start to upload
20:55 <@s991533> you can easily rent a VPS on digitalocean and seed from the VPS, very easy
20:56 <@s991533> only $5/month
21:04 < hualet> s991533: I can't decide that, anyway I'll suggest to them...
21:10 <@s991533> hualet: yeah, I know
21:11 <@s991533> I also help seeding the distros who didn't provide mirror
21:11 <@s991533> like {l,x,k}buntu
21:11 <@s991533> ubuntu-gnome, ubuntu-mate, etc ...
21:12 <@s991533> or small distros like bodhi, trisquel
21:12 <@s991533> that's what I can do to help open sourece and free software growing
21:14 <@s991533> upload about 2 TB avg via BT for opensource and free software every month
21:15 < hualet> s991533: you really good man ;)
21:20 <@s991533> my programming ability is not good enough to code to much, so I just seed and mirror projects
21:23 < alim0x> anyone use docky?
21:23 < hualet> s991533: that's good enough, I think ;)
21:24 < hualet> alim0x: probably not, what's you problem?
21:25 < alim0x> just asking :) seems have bug in Ubuntu
21:25 < hualet> alim0x: ok...
21:26 <@s991533> hualet: should be better, haha
21:27 < hualet> s991533: still busy today?
21:27 < alim0x> the deepin-icon-theme in Github, is it update with 2014.2 ?
21:28 < hualet> s991533: isn't it national holidays today in Taiwan?
21:28 < hualet> alim0x: let me check...
21:29 <@s991533> hualet: every day ..
21:29 <@s991533> hualet: yes it is
21:30 < hualet> alim0x: yeah, it's updated
21:30 < alim0x> ;) the icon-theme is amazing
21:30 < hualet> s991533: how long does the holiday last?
21:30 < alim0x> compare to 2014.1
21:31 <@s991533> 4 days
21:31 < hualet> alim0x: thanks, but there's also many people arguing that it's crap compared to the previous one ;)
21:33 < hualet> s991533: sort of jealous now... XD
21:33 < alim0x> my friend saw it yesterday and says "look like android"XD
21:34 < alim0x> I think the old one just don't have ONE style
21:34 <@s991533> xD
21:36 < hualet> alim0x: to be honest, I prefer the current icon set than the previous one except the RED terminal icon XD
21:38 < alim0x> lol, black and white/green is everyone's impress for old screen
21:39 < hualet> alim0x: yeah...that's true
21:41 <@s991533> hualet: I have to go, see you tomorrow
21:41  * s991533 Happy New Year 2015!
21:43 < hualet> s991533: see you

22:42 < hualet> arun_: mostly deepin-movie now ;)
22:43 < hualet> arun_: what about you, a geek or a dev?
22:57 < arun_> i m a geek n dev both..
22:58 < arun_> hualet: u from china?
