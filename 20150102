00:02 < brainy> hey arun_ happy new year :D
00:02 < brainy> thank you i feel good, just took a nap h
00:02 < brainy> how are you?
02:57 < IbsinRG> Hello, could someone help me please?
02:57 < IbsinRG> I can't seem to get Skype to install through the Deepin Store. And, when I tried to download it directly from the website, it said there was an error about a missing file.
10:28 < brainy> hi s991533_
10:29 < brainy> Where is your op status? haha
13:25 < s991533> ChanServ: give me op
13:25 < s991533> ChanServ: help
20:14 < brainy> hi all
20:15 < brainy> hi metak
20:16 < metak> wel hello brainy ;-)
20:16 < brainy> :D
20:17 < metak> doing better than last year?
20:20 < brainy> haha sure but i was also good last year
20:20 < brainy> hey metak can I ask you
20:21 < brainy> How many people download the DDE you ported to archlinux?
20:21 < brainy> Is it popular?
20:23 < metak> haha ;-)  there's no way I could know that... some people are obviosly using it and it works for them... there's active thread about it on archlinux forum... bug reports are filed on Fasheng's github page....
20:25 < brainy> that's nice metak :D
20:25 < metak> interested in trying it on arch? ;-)
20:27 < brainy> haha no i'm just curious
20:28 <@s991533> hi brainy 
20:29 <@s991533> arch is designed for geek I think ...
20:29 < metak> like I said... packages are built with OBS and hosted on their server and mirrors so there's no 'tracking' to know how how many people download or something...
20:29 <@s991533> hard to install :P
20:30 <@s991533> but archlinux has very good document
20:30 < brainy> hey s991533 :D
20:31 < metak> I'm khm khm.. "abusing" my current arch installation for four years now... and I would probably have to check the wiki again if I had to do reinstall... ;-)
20:31 < brainy> haha
20:35 < metak> I still don't quite understand why Deepin team decided not to provide torrents for their iso images...
20:42 < metak> brainy for me personally it's the simplicity and the ability to make your own package if you might need that keeps me on archlinux... I've tried creating rpm packages and writting spec files... also creating deb packages which is a total PITA... ;_)
20:43 < brainy> :D
20:43 < brainy> I can imagine every distro has its advantages and disadvantages
20:44 < metak> definitely...
20:44 < brainy> do you also run servers or just use linux on your desktop?
20:45 < metak> nah.. I'm just your 'average' user... desktop for me... when I manage to actually turn it on... it's old... very old... ;-)
20:45 < brainy> haha me too only desktop
20:47 < metak> how's MATE working for ya?
20:48 < brainy> well it feels fast and I had gotten used to using GNOME2, so Im happy its still alive :D
20:48 < brainy> everything works perfectly, even my nvidia card is running in full performance mode now haha
20:48 < brainy> i'm so happy
20:49 < brainy> And how about your PC...you said it was a bit old?
20:49 < brainy> Any performance issues?
20:49 < metak> it's nice to have something "lightweight" and stable to lean back on...
20:49 < metak> not just a bit...
20:50 < brainy> lol
20:50 < metak> it's a P4, with 2GB  of ram... and some old ATI graphics card...
20:51 < brainy> wowww !
20:51 < brainy> And you can run the latest version of KDE without any problems?
20:53 < metak> plasma-next still has some issues... plasma-shell starts eating lots of ram... latest KDE is new hardware...
20:54 < brainy> hmmmm I see.
20:55 < metak> but it runs KDE 4.14.3 just fine though...
20:57 < metak> kwin is by far the best wm and Dolphin is the best file manager IMO... I can't see myself using something else...
20:58 < brainy> It's when you find a distro and desktop environment you like
20:59 < brainy> There are sooo many choices with Linux that it takes a long time to try them all until you find something you love haha
20:59 < brainy> meant to say "It's nice when..." in the first sentence
21:00 < metak> yep... it's a combination of many small things that make a difference...
21:00 < metak> that's why so many peoplo prefer Nemo over Nautilus nowadays...
21:01 < metak> to be able to open a frickin' terminal in current dir... and things like that...
21:03 < brainy> true it's a nice feature :D
21:05 < metak> have you tried lxqt maybe?
21:06 <@s991533> metak: why so old xD
21:08 < metak> s991533: c'mon I'm not that old... I'm barely 26! Shhh.... we're gonny grow old together... ;-)
21:09 < metak> I don't really care... it still runs...
21:09 < brainy> haha
21:11 < metak> it's still enough to do most of the things that I need.. so... why waste money?
21:12 < brainy> Yeah I agree with you metak
21:13 < brainy> Especially with Linux you can run a slick distro on even very old PCs
21:13 < brainy> Can you do that with Windows ?? I doubt it
21:14 < brainy> Well maybe Windows 3.1
21:15 < metak> yes... and when I discovered OBS I just dumped pkgbuild files for them to build insted of me... so I still get the latest git snapshost without compiling... muahahahhaa ;-)
21:15 < brainy> lol thats so nice
21:17 < metak> and it's also publishing binaries for others if they want to use them... so it benefits everyone... ;_)
21:19 <@s991533> metak: I mean your PC
21:20 < metak> I know... I was just joking... ;-)
21:20 < brainy> s991533, haha
21:20 <@s991533> and ... P4 will use much power 
21:20 <@s991533> so I don't think you really save money
21:20 <@s991533> it's too old, use too much power and time to do a little work
21:23 < brainy> Really too much power?!
21:23 < brainy> Hmmmm
21:23 < brainy> I didn't take that into consideration
21:24 < metak> I'm saving money by not spending it on new PC... it's old and I know it eats more power then newer proccesors...
21:24 <@s991533> too much I think xD
21:25 < brainy> So it's always good to buy a new PC, s991533 ?
21:25 < metak> I was thinking about upgrading my PC to something made in this century... who knows... ;-)
21:25 <@s991533> of course not, but I think P4 is toooooo old
21:26 < metak> yep.. it is old
21:30 <@s991533> metak: don't you use PC to play game or watch vedio?
21:30 <@s991533> s/vedio/video/
21:32 < metak> games? who needs games... ;-) I can play chess without a problem and I don't play any other games... not into it... videos still play... up to HD... Full HD is a no go... ;-)
21:33 < arun> guys, anyone using centos?
21:35 <@s991533> metak: haha
21:35 <@s991533> arun: hi
21:35 < metak> s991533: you can always send me a new PC you know... I won't complain, I promisse! ;-)
21:35 <@s991533> arun: are you using now?
21:35 <@s991533> metak: I'll send you if you are in my country
21:35 < arun> s991533: what? CentOS ?
21:35 < arun> nah
21:35 <@s991533> arun: are you using centos now?
21:36 <@s991533> okay
21:36 <@s991533> arun: you wanna try it?
21:36 < arun> s991533: nope... I already have used
21:36 <@s991533> ha ...
21:36 <@s991533> you still keep changing your os
21:37 <@s991533> metak: do you live in Slovenia?
21:37 <@s991533> I think it's too far for me, haha
21:37 < arun> s991533: nope. I don't
21:37 < arun> I have Chitwanix in my host
21:38 < metak> yes, Slovenia... you?
21:38 <@s991533> metak: Taiwan
21:39 < metak> oh well.. just e-mail it to me... ;-)
21:40 < metak> is it that weird that I'm not playing games on my PC?
21:40 <@s991533> funny, haha ...
21:40 <@s991533> no, I don't play
21:40 <@s991533> but I play video
21:43 < metak> sure I also watch videos... but, I also have a limited mobile broadband connection so Full HD videos are out of the question anyway... in most cases...
21:43 < brainy> Yesterday I saw the movie Gravity
21:43 < brainy> I really liked it !
21:43 < brainy> Have you seen it?
21:45 < metak> Sandra Bullock and George Clooney?
21:45 < brainy> Yes metak
21:46 < metak> just that sounds horrible.... I just read synopsis and was like mehhh... I'll pass... you say its good?
21:48 < brainy> ha!
21:49 < brainy> I didn't know anything about this movie, the story, actors etc. I just watched...and in the end I liked it haha
21:49 <@s991533> metak: don't you have wired network?
21:49 <@s991533> brainy: I hate that movie ... xDDDD
21:50 <@s991533> It's boring for me, sorry xD
21:50 < metak> maybe I'll give it a shot... and blame brainy if I don't like it... ;-)
21:50 <@s991533> xDDDDDDD
21:52 < metak> s991533: wired network? I've come to a conclusion that it's my bad karma at work here! I live in a house where there are no cables laid yet... so... screw you karma! ;-)
21:55 < metak> brainy: have you seen the Interstellar? Judging by the description it's something simmilar to Gravity, right?
22:00 <@s991533> oh cool xD
22:02 < metak> Fasheng: hey hey... how is it going? I see that dde-daemon still fails to buil with latest 'go'? ;-)
22:04 < brainy> metak, no sorry, haven't seen that one yet
22:05 < metak> my brothers mention it to me... but, I don't know... these Hollywood movies are unbearable to watch...
22:06 < brainy> You prefer Bollywood? xD
22:07 < metak> hahahah ;-)  I prefer to just watch some anime...
22:07 < brainy> Ahh ok haha
22:08 < brainy> s991533, are Bollywood movies popular in Taiwan?
22:08 <@s991533> not really
22:08 <@s991533> only some movies are famous
22:09 < brainy> But I guess Jackie Chan is
22:09 < brainy> I love Jackie Chan! His stunts are awesome haha
22:10 <@s991533> kind of, haha
22:10 < brainy> He jumps from building to building like he doesn't care.
22:11 <@s991533> he don't use his brain to think and just say something may make others angry ...
22:11 <@s991533> I meant sometimes
22:11 <@s991533> BTW, do you know his son?
22:12 <@s991533> he drug and now under arrested ...
22:12 <@s991533> in Beijing if I didn't remember it wrong
22:15 < brainy> hmm yes I heard about his son
22:15 < brainy> What did Jackie Chan say that has upset people, s991533 ?
22:15 < brainy> I don't understand Chinese so I don't know all the things he says :)
22:17 <@s991533> just something stupid, I don't remember that xD
22:17 <@s991533> very will really make some people angry
22:18 <@s991533> just useless things
22:18 <@s991533> arun: so why are you asking centos?
22:19 <@s991533> metak: do you know Canon? from Japan
22:19 < metak> No... do tell.
22:22 < metak> not the Canon company?
22:22 <@s991533> metak: http://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/
22:22 <@s991533> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Closed
22:22 <@s991533> brainy: what about you? do you know it xD?

22:23 < brainy> haha! I saw some episodes

22:26 <@s991533> ping arun 
22:26 <@s991533> ping arun 
22:26 <@s991533> ping arun 
22:27 <@s991533> I am missing our bot now, so that I can use .wiki conan, .google conan xD
22:28 < brainy> hahaha
22:28 < brainy> s991533, I think your bot was nice, but it shouldn't always have said "hi" or "lol"
22:28 < brainy> xD
22:32 <@s991533> yeah
22:33 < metak> s991533: so, I'm like I'll check it out... and there are 762 episodes! Mkay... ;-) why god... why?
22:34 <@s991533> what does Mkey mean? 
22:34 <@s991533> you think it's too many? 
22:34 <@s991533> I think there should be more xDDDDD
22:34 < metak> mkay*  as in okay.... ok...
22:34 <@s991533> it also have comic books and movies
22:35 <@s991533> metak: okay, thanks
22:35 < arun> s991533:  brainy cause I needed some screenshots for my blog... NICs bonding...
22:35 < brainy> haha 762 episodes
22:35 <@s991533> so what are you asking why here xD?
22:35 < brainy> arun, ah ok man :)
22:35 <@s991533> arun: I think googld can help you
22:35 < metak> I thought One piece was enough... I don't know if have enough life in me for another marathon! ;-)
22:35 < brainy> 762 episode, if you watch 1 every day, you'll finish after 2 years hahaha
22:35 <@s991533> arun: may I have your blog's url?
22:36 <@s991533> brainy: usually I watch 2~3 eps/day
22:36 <@s991533> but not every day
22:36 <@s991533> metak: you should try it first xDDD
22:37 < metak> I'll definitelly watch few episodes to get a feel of it...
22:38 <@s991533> okay
22:38 <@s991533> hope you like it xD
22:38 < metak> still waiting for third season of High-school DXD...  ;-)
22:44 <@s991533> metak: are you high school student?
22:45 < metak> lol NO... I just think that anime is hillarious. It speaks to my inner perv, you know. ;-)
22:51 < brainy> I just notice that the Linux file managers are missing a nice features that Windows has
22:52 < metak> brainy: like..?
22:52 < brainy> When I open file manager to see all partitions, in Windows there is automatically a display of how much space is used/free on every partition
22:52 < brainy> like C:\ 70% free etc.
22:52 < brainy> or 120Gb free
22:53 < brainy> But I think KDE file manager has this feature?? I'm not sure
22:55 <@s991533> I'm not sure 
22:55 <@s991533> but linux has different thought
22:55 <@s991533> windows usually doesn't 'mount'
22:55 < brainy> Linux doesn't care about free space haha
22:56 < brainy> Ok s991533 but let's just say your root partition
22:56 < brainy> It's nice to always have an overview of how much space is left in my opinion
22:56 < brainy> I know there are tools for this or console..but it would be an ice addon in file manager ;)
22:57 <@s991533> but it's not real if you mount another partition on it
22:57 <@s991533> I mean in file manager
22:57 < brainy> ok but root partitionnnnnn
22:57 <@s991533> because it won't show a full path
22:57 <@s991533> I think df is the easiest and fastest way for me xD
22:58 < brainy> :)
22:58 < metak> brainy: Dolphin has this feature to ALLWAYS show at the bottom free and used space for current dir...
22:58 < brainy> metak, ha! that's good
22:58 < metak> also for KDE there's https://www.kde.org/applications/system/kinfocenter/
22:59 < metak> this shows more in detail info about partitions and such...
22:59 < brainy> I knowwww there are simple tools for this :D
22:59 < brainy> Butttt it would be nice to have an overview once I hope file manager, that's just my opinion ;)
23:00 < brainy> http://winsupersite.com/site-files/winsupersite.com/files/archive/winsupersite.com/content/content/128659/win7/win7_m3_explorer_01.jpg
23:01 < brainy> Like this
23:04 < brainy> welcome back arun
23:04 < arun> thanks brainy
23:05 < arun> brainy: I needed to have 2 NICs bonding ... command executed screenshots
23:06 < metak> brainy: closest thing to that would be what Nemo FM does... and also Konqueror (former default FM in KDE)... they can both show progressbar to indicate used/free space...
23:09 < brainy> ok metak
23:09 < brainy> arun, and did you succeed?!
23:14 < Karbowiak> brainy, metak why not do it like OSX, show "free of total" in the bottom of the window
23:14 < Karbowiak> seems like the easy way out
23:15 < brainy> hi Karbowiak :D
23:16 < brainy> Karbowiak, well I just see when I open a partition with Caja file manager, it shows me the amount of free space at the bottom
23:16 < metak> https://www.kde.org/announcements/4.4/screenshots/44_dolphin_search.jpg
23:16 < brainy> But I would prefer a graphical display :D
23:17 < metak> on the left you have available space... and free at the bottom... ;-)
23:17 < Karbowiak> one could discuss why
23:17 < Karbowiak> isn't simple the way forward ?
23:17 < brainy> ha! that's nice
23:17 < brainy> Karbowiak, I guess it's matter of preference
23:18 < Karbowiak> true
23:18 < Karbowiak> :)
23:20 < brainy> Has any of you ever changed his desktop to look completely like Windows or Mac OS? haha
23:21 < brainy> I once changed to Windows 7 look...it felt weird xD
23:22 < brainy> I was trying to open Explorer with Win+E but it didn't work haha
23:22 < metak> not really...
23:23 < metak> Mac OS... yes, I tried that "transformation" pack that around for linux long ago... ;-)
23:32 < brainy> metak, and did you like it?
23:33 < metak> not my thing... besides, those were gtk themes and I berely use gtk based apps.. only when absolutelly neccessary... ;-)
23:34 < metak> they both "hide" too much
23:35 < metak> I like to have a big-ass taskabar at the bottom showin windows from all desktops...
23:35 < metak> and one small at the top with all those small things... ;-)
23:37 < metak> what do you customize with you MATE?
23:41 < brainy> metak, I changed it to look like Deepin 12.06 haha
23:42 < brainy> Because I liked that looked but the distro was old in terms of software
23:43 < metak> it did look nice
23:48 < metak> gonna go now for a while... take care everone. ;-)
23:50 < brainy> cu metak :)
23:59 <@s991533> see you metak
