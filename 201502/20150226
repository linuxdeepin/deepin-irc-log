03:27 < dadix> I know the project from some time
03:27 < dadix> but I am not a programmer
03:28 < dadix> but maybe I can help you
03:29 < arun_> dadix: can we install DDE in debian or Xubuntu without affecting the current system?
03:32 < dadix> on debian I don't know
03:32 < dadix> but in xubuntu is it possible, I think
04:32 < dadix> but you will need to download so many thing and finally you will transform Xubuntu into Linux Deepin so is not a good idea from my point of view

23:24 < nitwit> Hello, I'm having some trouble with finding man pages for a few functions
23:24 < nitwit> specifically man 2 open, for the C system call
23:26 < nitwit> alright I figured it out, needed to install manpages-dev, but is this standard for most distros? manpages-dev not being installed by default I mean
