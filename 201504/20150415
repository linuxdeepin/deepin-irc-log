22:18 < Champion_The> http://wiki.deepin.org/index.php?title=Graphics_Card#Install_closed-source_graphics_driver
22:18 < Champion_The> but I don't understand Chinese
22:40 < Donatello> I installed Deepin to check it out but the updates don't work.  It just sits there doin nothin.
22:41 < Donatello> Says 252 updates available.
23:27 < Champion_The> is here a deepin developer or somebody
23:27 < vodkode_> heya guys
23:28 < Champion_The> I have i7 4500U and the system is laggy and slow
23:31 < vodkode_> that doesn't sound right
23:31 < vodkode_> I installed deepin most recently on an AMD E2-1800 (1.7ghz APU) and it fleq
23:31 < vodkode_> flew
23:33 < Champion_The> is it better to install any proprietary intel drivers? for HD 4400
23:34 < Champion_The> but yeah I updated kernel to 4.0 recently..
23:34 < Champion_The> so maybe that might cause something
