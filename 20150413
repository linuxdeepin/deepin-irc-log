19:10 < hualet> yo brainy ;)
19:10 < brainy> hey hualet :D
19:11 < hualet> early today, huh
19:11 < hualet> brainy: what are you doing, bro
19:13 < brainy> early xD
19:15 < brainy> hualet: I am just browsing through the Mint Software Manager to see what is available.
19:16 < brainy> hualet: Do you play any Linux games ?!
20:03 < hualet> brainy: sorry, just left for a few minutes to eat my dinner
20:04 < hualet> brainy: and I don't play any games on linux
20:18 < brainy> ok hualet
20:18 < brainy> hi vodkode_
20:18 < vodkode_> heya brainy
20:18 < brainy> hualet: vodkode_ is a happy Deepin-customer
20:19 < vodkode_> That is true, I am thoroughly impressed with deepin
20:19 < vodkode_> A+ on that distribution, I think its the first linux distribution that my fiancee wanted me to install for her on a laptop :)
20:22 < hualet> vodkode_: really? that's great ;)
20:22 < hualet> vodkode_: and thank you for trying
20:23 < vodkode_> I love it, very professional distro, I was actually shocked I hadn't heard of it before
20:23 < vodkode_> I have used WPS office for a very long time
20:24 < hualet> vodkode_: haha, when did you start using deepin?
20:24 < vodkode_> I started using it about 2 months ago
20:25 < vodkode_> I still use other distros, mainly because it's a pain to move so much content/apps/settings/etc, but I use deepin as well
20:25 < vodkode_> I am putting deepin on my media center PC today
20:26 < vodkode_> I think deepin needs to petition to get more reviews, somehow get more coverage
20:29 < hualet> vodkode_: yeah, that's true, but we're just a small team at the moment, we don't have spare time to answering more petitions, but we're working on it ;)
20:29 < vodkode_> Well I cant believe what you guys did, you guys did a hell of a job for a small team
20:29 < vodkode_> The installer is perfect
20:29 < hualet> vodkode_: it's fast, right XD
20:30 < vodkode_> Not just fast, its professional looking, it looks like commercial software
20:31 < hualet> vodkode_: good to know that you guys like it ;)
