06:31 < rigor789> Hey, I'm having some trouble lately with deepin
06:31 < rigor789> black screen with x cursor, and can't seem to find a solution for it
06:31 < rigor789> startx worked for some time
06:31 < rigor789> but now that won't work either
06:32 < rigor789> If I boot into the installation media, can I "reinstall" with keeping my files settings?
16:53 < hohoho> 深度的讨论区？
