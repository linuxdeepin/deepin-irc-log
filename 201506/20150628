20:09 < Mitchell92[A]> Hi... I'm trying to help a friend who is new to linux, and I've never used deepin. He is trying to install kvirc. What is deepin based on? Trying to see if he can run a command from the terminal to install it.

20:11 < dadix> ubuntu 14.04
20:11 < Mitchell92> great, thanks
20:11 < Mitchell92> i'm assuming it uses apt-get?
20:11 < Mitchell92> i'm sorry, i'm a suse user myself
20:11 < dadix> yes
20:11 < Mitchell92> ok
20:12 < dadix> np
20:12 < Mitchell92> :) Thanks
20:12 < Mitchell92> I'm a suse user, although recently I've been using a new macbook pro, I run suse and windows 7 in vmware though.
20:12 < Mitchell92> retired my prior computer with suse on it
20:13 < dadix> do you know to work with blender 3d?
20:13 < Mitchell92> I do not. :( I don't do 3d modeling, other than some simple stuff in illustrator
20:14 < dadix> ok
20:15 < Mitchell92> a bit sad about only having a 250GB SSD on this, I only have about 109GB free. :( I have a retina macbook pro with a quad core i7 with hyper threading, and 16GB of RAM.
20:15 < Mitchell92> although I love the OS X experience.
20:16 < dadix> good for you I think, but I like gnu/linux
20:16 < dadix> better than anything else
20:20 < Mitchell92> I am not saying I dislike gnu/linux - I still have computers running it, as well as servers. :)
20:21 < Mitchell92> I just ended up buying a computer for school, and it happens to be running OS X.
20:29 < dadix> ok
