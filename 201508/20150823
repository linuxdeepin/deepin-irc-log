09:57 < hualet> aryan__: haha, our Operation & Maintenance Engineer, a friend of mine, what's the problem?
09:59 < aryan__> hualet, not problem, but I wanted to know which package is completely responsible for the login screen ie lightdm
10:00 < aryan__> I got some thing that, your login screen and every deepin environment is under a single source package ie workspace. why that so ?
10:03 < hualet> aryan__: all the components in dde-workspace share a lot of code, maybe that's why they put it all together
10:03 < aryan__> Ah I see.
10:03 < aryan__> hualet, So, you guys are running lightdm with webkit login right ?>
10:03 < hualet> aryan__: 张月乾 is our former package manager, now he is not responsible for that
10:04 < aryan__> hualet, Ah OK :)
10:06 < aryan__> s991533, where you go ?
10:07 < aryan__> Is there any active community of Deepin currently ? hualet
