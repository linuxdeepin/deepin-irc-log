21:44 < aryan> vodkode, OK no problem.
21:44 < aryan> yeah its highly fancy
21:44 < vodkode> the devs that come here are really friendly people
21:44 < aryan> but a bit slow in slow PC
21:44 < vodkode> very approachable good guys

21:47 < vodkode> I always wanted to visit Nepal
21:47 < aryan> vodkode, you know Nepal ?
21:47 < aryan> cool :)
21:47 < vodkode> I lived in the Philippines for over a year and I wanted to travel there, but was unable to

21:47 < vodkode> yes of course, Nepal is beautiful
21:47 < aryan> vodkode, yeah ! :D
21:48 < aryan> vodkode, thanks for that. :D
21:48 < aryan> The thing is that, I wanted to modify the login screen of deepin but don't know the package.
21:49 < vodkode> I forget the devs names to be honest, been a while
21:49 < vodkode> I haven't chatted to them in some time
21:49 < vodkode> they are really nice Chinese guys
21:49 < aryan> boqOK :F
21:49 < vodkode> very helpful
21:49 < aryan> vodkode, OK :D
21:49 < aryan> brainy, where you go ?
21:50 < brainy> aryan: yes you are right, more devs here would be nice :D
21:50 < brainy> So we could ask questions.
21:50 < aryan> brainy, yeah bro
21:50 < aryan> brainy, you know me ?
21:51 < brainy> aryan: You made a Nepalese distro, right?
21:51 < aryan> brainy, yeah, you recognized me :D
21:51 < vodkode> aryan what is your area of Nepal?
21:51 < vodkode> Have you traveled in your country a lot?
21:51 < brainy> aryan: of course i do xD
21:51 < vodkode> it looks gorgeous there
21:51 < vodkode> brainy you are German yes?
21:51 < aryan> vodkode, naa bro I haven't travelled all but some places.
21:51 < vodkode> what part of Germany?
21:51 < brainy> Yes Nepal looks very beautiful
21:51 < brainy> vodkode: I'm from Berlin
21:52 < vodkode> a Berliner! the heart of the teutonic beast :D
21:52 < aryan> Isn't germany the one who won last FIFA Word Cup ?
21:52 < brainy> lol
21:52 < brainy> yes aryan
21:52 < aryan> brainy, congrats :D
21:52 < brainy> haha thanks
21:52 < vodkode> my fiancee is 50% cherokee indian (native american) and 50% german
21:52 < vodkode> her mother grew up in stuttgart
21:52 < brainy> wow nice
21:52 < vodkode> my aunt is from Cologne
21:53 < brainy> Thats why you speak German :D
21:53 < vodkode> no, I only know some, i studied it when i was young
21:53 < vodkode> I am about 50% german and 50% spanish/portugese/irish
21:53 < brainy> That's very nice, vodkode
21:53 < aryan> vodkode, great (y)
21:53 < aryan> what you do vodkode for living ?
21:53 < brainy> aryan: wasn't your nick ArunPiyasi? :D
21:53 < aryan> brainy, yup
21:53 < brainy> ok :)
21:54 < vodkode> I'm a business developer, IT businesses, I worked in outsourcing/white label space for a long time
21:54 < aryan> cool
21:54 < vodkode> I was also a clinical research coordinator conducting phase trials of medications
21:54 < aryan> vodkode, you are a medical guy ?
21:55 < vodkode> but now, I am making a big change in my career, I'm going into green building and craft construction
21:55 < vodkode> yes and no
21:55 < vodkode> clinical researchers are not so much medical as they are clinical, you dont treat ailments, you apply research substances to test subjects
21:55 < vodkode> and document the outcome
21:56 < vodkode> I didnt like it at all, it was disgusting to me in a way and I quit doing that because I realized how corrupt it was
21:56 < vodkode> its all designed for profit and not for helping mankind
21:56 < vodkode> they invent a dangerous drug that happens to be able to be patented and ignore a harmless drug or remedy that cannot be profitable
21:56 < vodkode> so we wind up with a lot of drugs that harm/kill ppl
21:56 < vodkode> needlessly
21:56 < brainy> That's sad :(
21:57 < vodkode> it costs so much to test a drug for a specific application that there will never be money put into testing herbal remedies or cheaper drugs developed in the former soviet union for example
21:57 < vodkode> so nothing developed by them is used here, it is labeled unfit for humans, but it will never be tested to be fit
21:57 < vodkode> same with Chinese drugs
21:58 < vodkode> etc
21:58 < vodkode> anyway thats that, I went into IT and I have been a geek my entire life, so, working in white label was a natural thing for me to do, I really liked it and I got to travel, now I am back in Florida and getting married :D
21:59 < vodkode> I'm very interested in renewable construction, I studied cob (mud brick) construction a lot and I hope to apply that to building sustainable things like outdoor ovens, walls, patios, etc
21:59 < aryan> ok
21:59 < vodkode> someday maybe whole houses
21:59 < vodkode> how about you guys?
21:59 < vodkode> what is your story?
21:59 < aryan> vodkode, congratulations bro
22:00 < vodkode> thank you
22:02 < brainy> Yeah, congrats man
22:03 < vodkode> what about you guys?
22:03 < vodkode> what do you do brainy?
22:03 < vodkode> or you aryan?
22:03 < brainy> vodkode: A lot of people speak Spanish in Florida, right?
22:04 < vodkode> yes
22:04 < vodkode> in some parts
22:04 < vodkode> it depends where you live
22:04 < brainy> Yes I see
22:04 < vodkode> in the south it is tropical here and many cuban people, in the severe north it is like a southern state, very rural and country with a different culture
22:04 < aryan> vodkode, as brainy told I am a developer of a linux distro and more over I am a Linux System Admin and web developer
22:04 < brainy> vodkode: I just give basic computer lessons to beginners, that's all :)
22:05 < vodkode> I live north of tampa about 1 hours drive, it is very much the country here, with a mixture of farming type people and retirees, very few spanish speakers
22:05 < vodkode> aryan very cool
22:05 < vodkode> what is your distro?
22:05 < aryan> brainy, hows your days going on bro ? long time been right we didn't have chat
22:05 < brainy> vodkode: I love the weather in Florida xD
22:05 < vodkode> brainy it gets old!
22:05 < aryan> vodkode, its called Chitwanix
22:05 < brainy> Yes aryan , everything is fine bro thanks
22:05 < aryan> brainy, cool
22:05 < vodkode> I am sorry I dont know metric but it is 95 - 110 degrees F here
22:06 < vodkode> its so hot and rainy lately that I havent even been outside
22:06 < brainy> Thats very hot vodkode
22:06 < aryan> wpw 110 F !!
22:06 < aryan> thats the fever temperature hehe
22:06 < vodkode> yes its and depending where you live there are also mosquitoes like crazy that bite and carry diseases
22:06 < vodkode> and all this wet breeds roaches
22:06 < vodkode> its not hospitable in the summer months here at all
22:06 < vodkode> I would rather be in Berlin!
22:07 < aryan> vodkode, Oops stay safe bro
22:07 < brainy> ha, yes I cam imagine
22:07 < vodkode> Chitwanix, I will look it up aryan, very cool
22:08 < vodkode> I was going to contribute to GhostBSD but basically it was hard to communicate with the team the way it was setup and I was busy, so I stopped
22:08 < vodkode> years ago I helped with MorphOS
22:08 < vodkode> I released an iconpack for it
22:08 < vodkode> and I contributed to the late LindowsOS waaay back
22:08 < vodkode> I did the 3D video intro for it
22:08 < brainy> Lindows xD
22:08 < brainy> I remember that one
22:09 < vodkode> being German I am surprised you dont remember MorphOS
22:09 < aryan> vodkode, those iconpack default is your design ?
22:09 < vodkode> bPlan is German and the MOS team is primarily German and French
22:09 < vodkode> I worked or Genesi-Sarl GmBH when I was a 16, first job I ever had :D
22:09 < vodkode> aryan not the defaut one, it is called the meers pack
22:09 < vodkode> I did that one
22:10 < vodkode> it might have been incorporated into the main OS now though
22:10 < vodkode> I released it public domain, I didn't get into licensing
22:11 < vodkode> I may release my entire 3D library of models and everything public domain this year, been contemplating it
22:11 < vodkode> I like to see my work copied/used
22:11 < vodkode> but its so many GB's of data its like blah :(
22:11 < vodkode> 24gb of shit
22:11 < aryan> great (y)
22:12 < aryan> vodkode, u did with blender ?
22:12 < aryan> vodkode, did you do fist job with desgin ?
22:13 < brainy> 24gb ?? WOW
22:13 < aryan> I think I got the login screen finally
22:13 < aryan> I gotta study the codes now.
22:13 < brainy> aryan: Where is it located?
22:13 < vodkode> yes design
22:13 < vodkode> no not blender
22:14 < aryan> brainy, the design is under dde
22:14 < brainy> ok
22:14 < vodkode> I started on SI|3D and then migrated to Lightwave
22:14 < aryan> vodkode, OK I hope they are FOSS
22:14 < vodkode> I also did a ton of 2D work using Newtek Aura/Mirage then TVPaint (It changed names a lot)
22:14 < brainy> I think 3D stuff is so cool
22:14 < brainy> But it takes a lot of time to master?
22:14 < vodkode> no, the apps I used are not FOSS, but I owned them
22:15 < vodkode> yeah, I spent years learning 3D, I eventually kind of dumped it because its hard to make a living, but kept it up as a hobby for ages
22:15 < vodkode> here is a website I made with some of my work from about 15 years ago
22:15 < vodkode> www.themagda.com
22:15 < vodkode> god I'm old
22:15 < brainy> wow
22:16 < aryan> OK

22:16 < vodkode> my friend from Holland keeps it up for me
22:16 < aryan> I just got mail from deepin developer.

23:44 < vodkode> I like to feel free from technology sometimes
23:46 < brainy> Yeah, smartphones have advantages and disadvantages for sure
23:47 < brainy> vodkode: But when you can create 3d models on your smartphone you'll get a new one? :D
