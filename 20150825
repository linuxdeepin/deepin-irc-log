20:39 < brainy> Really?
20:39 < brainy> Okay bro
20:39 < arunpyasi> its just that there are Brahmin peoples (saints) in India and Nepal who are pure veg.
20:40 < arunpyasi> brainy, some 20-30 years ago there were many brahmin who were pure veg but now most of the brahmins are starting to eat meats.
