18:33 < brainy> When there is a new version for a Linux Distro, for example Ubuntu, do you recommend to upgrade the existing version to the new version or a complete re-install of new version?
18:33 < brainy> Is it safe to upgrade?
18:36 < arunpyasi> yes usually they are safe :D But unless they don't break Hehe lol
18:36 < brainy> ok :_D
18:36 < arunpyasi> I recommend not to upgrade LTS release to other unstable release. But upgrading between unstable is fine.
18:36 < brainy> ok thanks arunpyasi
18:37 < arunpyasi> But if you don't have that important docs/files/ etc its good to clean install.
