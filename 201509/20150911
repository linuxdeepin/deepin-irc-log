23:18 < vodkode> :D
23:18 < vodkode> I heard you guys are getting huge huge huge numbers of immigrants now
23:18 < brainy> lol
23:18 < brainy> vodkode: yes that's true
23:18 < vodkode> its in the news here that germany is turning muslim/etc
23:19 < vodkode> government wants 800K/year to come
23:19 < brainy> i don't think they want them to come but they are coming
23:19 < brainy> so its a reality
23:19 < vodkode> very tough situation
23:19 < brainy> it will be dificult
23:20 < brainy> yep
23:20 < vodkode> how will you handle that many people who have no skills and cannot work and so on?
23:20 < vodkode> at least our illegal immigrants here, they work
23:20 < brainy> i hope they will give them some good education
23:20 < vodkode> they aren't dangerous either (not really anyway, despite the propoganda)
23:20 < brainy> and that they learn german fast
23:21 < brainy> yes you have many people from mexico right?
23:21 < vodkode> yes
23:21 < vodkode> but hopefully Trump fights it and shuts it down
23:21 < vodkode> he wants to deport millions and build a huge wall
23:21 < vodkode> start putting business owners in prison who hire them, etc
23:21 < brainy> the cubans that live in florida are well educated most of them i think?
23:22 < vodkode> no not at all
23:22 < brainy> lol Donald Trump
23:22 < vodkode> the ones from 50 years ago yes
23:22 < brainy> ah ok
23:22 < vodkode> but they aren't cuban now, they are american
23:22 < brainy> yes
23:22 < vodkode> brb
23:22 < brainy> ok
23:25 < hualet> hey, don't stop talking ;)
23:25 < hualet> I'm reading and trying to follow you two
23:25 < brainy> hualet: lol
23:27 < hualet> brainy: I meant to argue something about git in #emacs with somebody, but I don't know how to put it in English, so I gave up finally :(
23:28 < hualet> it's good to be born to be able to speak English
23:29 < brainy> hualet: yes I know what you are talking about, sometimes it's hard to express oneself
23:29 < brainy> in a foreign language
23:29 < hualet> brainy: yeah, that's what I'm talking about
23:30 < hualet> I need much more practice XD
23:31 < brainy> hualet: I think watching movies will help you a lot
23:32 < brainy> with english subtitles would be even better
23:32 < hualet> brainy: actually that's the way I learn english
23:32 < brainy> hualet: Perfect! :D
23:33 < hualet> I watched a lot of Hollywood movies and US series
23:33 < hualet> but now I spend most of my time working
23:34 < brainy> Working is good, you will be rich! :_D
23:34 < brainy> Especially since you are a programmer
23:35 < brainy> nah just joking, but earning money isn't that bad
23:35 < hualet> brainy: I doubt that, haha ;)
23:35 < brainy> lol
23:38 < hualet> brainy: I saw a lot of German devs in Qt/QtCreator mailing list, why's that?
23:48 < brainy> hualet: hmmmm I really can't tell you, sorry :D
23:48 < brainy> I don't know why they like it
23:49 < hualet> brainy: do you like kde?
23:49 < brainy> hualet: Oh yes that might be it
23:49 < brainy> KDE was created by Germans I believe
23:50 < brainy> hualet: I liked the versions until KDE4
23:50 < brainy> Now I prefer mate
23:50 < hualet> you don't like KDE5 style?
23:50 < brainy> and you hualet ?
23:50 < brainy> I don't like KDE4
23:50 < hualet> brainy: I think KDE5 is better than KDE4
23:50 < brainy> Havent looked at KDE5 _D
23:51 < brainy> I will take a look hualet bro
23:51 < hualet> it's more modern
23:51 < hualet> but I'm not a fan of KDE, I'm a fan of Qt actually ;)
23:52 < brainy> In my opinion KDE beginning from version 4 seems a bit heavy and slow
23:52 < brainy> So I prefer the old Gnome
23:54 < hualet> brainy: aha, I know the old saying - "old habits die hard" right ? :P
23:58 < brainy> xD
