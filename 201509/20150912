01:44 < brainy> welcome back arunpyasi
01:45 < arunpyasi> brainy, man, this internet is resetting time and again
01:45 < arunpyasi> brainy, you are a good designer right ?
01:46 < brainy> arunpyasi: no, not at all :D
01:47 < brainy> arunpyasi: you must do lots of backups then bro
01:48 < arunpyasi> brainy, lots of backups ?
01:49 < brainy> arunpyasi: because you said electricity in nepal sometimes shuts down
01:49 < arunpyasi> ahh but
01:50 < arunpyasi> now not issue of electricity
01:50 < arunpyasi> internet is restting..
01:50 < arunpyasi> looks a server issue
02:01 < brainy> arunpyasi: oh that's bad man
02:02 < vodkode> hah
02:02 < vodkode> where I am from in Connecticut, USA the power once went out for almost a month due to a storm
02:02 < vodkode> in the winters we routinely lost power for 2 - 3 days at a time
02:02 < arunpyasi> wow
02:03 < vodkode> the worst is it does it when it is cold so you need to have a supply of kerosene or wood to heat your home or else you can freeze because in my area roads became impassable for days
02:03 < vodkode> we also got hit a couple times by what they called 'snowicaines' like a typhoon but instead of rain it is snow
02:04 < vodkode> I was in Makati when Manila was hit in 2011 by that big Typhoon it was awesomely powerful
02:25 < brainy> hi erhandsome
