17:21 < brainy> hi hualet bro
17:22 < hualet> hi brainy ;)
17:22 < hualet> you don't need rest, do you?
17:25 < brainy> hualet: why? It's 11:25 am here :D
17:25 < brainy> I just had rest
17:26 < brainy> But arunpiyasi told me he didn't sleep for 2 days :D
17:27 < hualet> brainy: for what?
17:27 < hualet> arunpiyasi is not here today...
17:27 < brainy> hualet: not today, I mean last week :_D
17:28 < hualet> brainy: ok...
17:28 < brainy> hualet: I'm glad that you are in charge of deepin now! its so cool
17:28 < hualet> brainy: how long is it since s991533_ had been disappeared ?
17:28 < brainy> loool
17:29 < brainy> hualet: We must find him
17:29 < hualet> brainy: no, man, don't take it wrong, I'm not in charge of deepin now
17:29 < brainy> ok hualet
17:29 < hualet> I'm just working as the team leader of deepin 2015 devs
17:29 < hualet> for now
17:30 < hualet> the job will be hopefully switched to other people
17:30 < hualet> then I can get some rest and we can have a long chat ;)
17:31 < hualet> we have too much work to do to catch up XD
17:31 < brainy> ok hualet
17:41 < bet0x> I will be back to xubuntu! :(
17:41 < brainy> why bet0x ?
17:42 < bet0x> Deepin has a lot of weird issues
17:42 < bet0x> and i can't work with a unstable desktop :(
17:43 < brainy> Sorry to hear :(
17:44 < bet0x> Where deepin save the video configuration?
17:44 < bet0x> I do use 3 displays with 1 card
17:44 < bet0x> is a mess to configure
17:44 < bet0x> :P
17:44 < brainy> Maybe hualet knows
17:44 < bet0x> Also another thing wich i hate is they live on china and is kinda impossible to find any dev to talk
17:45 < hualet> bet0x: hmmm...what's wrong, buddy ;)
17:46 < bet0x> Desktop doesn't allow cration of shortcuts
17:46 < bet0x> can't rezise anything using normal key conbinations
17:46 < hualet> bet0x: which version are you using ?
17:46 < hualet> 2014.3 stable or 2015 alpha ?
17:47 < bet0x> the one stable
17:47 < bet0x> hualet: there is a feature wich every linux desktop has
17:47 < bet0x> is a fast resize of windows
17:47 < bet0x> and remember where you place them
17:48 < bet0x> after i close a terminal for example the DDE doens't remember where i close it
17:48 < bet0x> and opens anywhere on my 3 displays
17:48 < bet0x> The resize feature is used with ALT + right click
17:48 < bet0x> but deppin doesn't have it
17:48 < bet0x> hualet: what's the new on 2015?
17:49 < hualet> bet0x: we switched to debian
17:49 < bet0x> hualet: thank god!
17:49 < bet0x> hualet: you will keep using the driver manager from Linux Mint?
17:49 < hualet> bet0x: I think that's caused by compiz
17:49 < bet0x> hualet: because it works better than the one from Ubuntu
17:49 < bet0x> hualet: can i remove compiz?
17:50 < hualet> maybe you should try another Window Manger
17:50  * bet0x likes DDE
17:50 < hualet> bet0x: sorry, you can't :(
17:50 < bet0x> dang! Y_Y
17:51 < hualet> DDE relies on compiz to work properly
17:51 < hualet> but you can install another WM without compiz removed
17:52 < bet0x> hualet: but won't be Deepin anymore right? :P
17:52 < hualet> bet0x: the good new is that we also switched to mutter over compiz
17:52 < bet0x> hualet: can i do testing? where i can download that
17:52 < bet0x> hualet: also i did a mirror on Texas and Mexico.
17:53 < bet0x> Because the speed was killing me
17:53 < bet0x> i do have my own 1 Gbps!
17:53 < bet0x> i will send a email with that to be listed later!
17:54 < bet0x> hualet: also i compiter the kernel 4.2 and runs like a 40% faster now
17:55 < hualet> bet0x: 40% ?! haha, I don't know
17:55 < hualet> bet0x: where do you live?
17:55 < bet0x> hualet: i did compile it by selecting every single device on my machine! :D
17:55 < bet0x> my kernel is like 7mb lol
17:56 < bet0x> hualet: a good idea will be to have a "kernel selector" where you use a kernel optimized for your machine, thats a feature not really present on any distro
17:56 < hualet> bet0x: cool, I haven't used a self-compiled kernel before
17:56 < bet0x> well maybe the RT or lowlatency ones
17:56 < bet0x> but those kernels still crap
17:57 < hualet> because that's lots of work
17:57 < bet0x> hualet: well it can be done
17:57  * bet0x will help with that
17:57 < bet0x> hualet: http://cdimage.linuxdeepin.com/daily-live/20150605/ this is the 2015?
17:57 < bet0x> for testing?
17:59 < hualet> bet0x: I'm not sure
17:59 < hualet> I don't think so, only the testing team in our forum can access to the lastest 2015 alpha build
18:00 < bet0x> i can do? :D
18:01 < hualet> bet0x: of course you can participant, but you should register first
18:01 < bet0x> username bet0x
18:01 < bet0x> :D
18:02 < hualet> let me find you a link
18:03 < hualet> bet0x: sorry man, I think the testing is over...
18:04 < bet0x> damn T_T
18:04 < bet0x> When will be released?
18:04 < bet0x> there is any ETA?
18:06 < hualet> bet0x: on December
18:06 < hualet> hopefully

18:11 < bet0x> and start to work on the kernel thing
18:20 < brainy> good job bet0x
18:20 < hualet> bet0x: great ;)
