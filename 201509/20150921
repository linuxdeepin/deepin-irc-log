11:22 < hualet> felixonmars: hi, are you online?
11:23 < felixonmars> hualet: yes
11:23 < hualet> felixonmars: about the PR that switch python-xcb to python-xcffib
11:24 < hualet> there's some problems should be settled first
11:24 < felixonmars> ok
11:25 < hualet> first, xpybutils should accept your PR first, I think, right?
11:26 < felixonmars> yes
11:26 < hualet> second, release/2.3 of deepin-movie hasn't been in a stable state yet, are you sure you want that?
11:27 < felixonmars> i sent the patch to release/2.2, but fasheng re-assigned it to release/2.3
11:27 < hualet> XD
11:28 < felixonmars> either way is ok, though :)
11:28 < hualet> ok, I'll talk to fasheng about it later XD
11:29 < felixonmars> i'll ping xpybutil's upstream sometime later if there is still no action
11:29 < felixonmars> for now i am busy on python 3.5 rebuild for arch :D
11:30 < hualet> felixonmars: ok, and I'll get some suggestions from our packager too
11:30 < hualet> felixonmars: I think we should talk to each other more often
11:30 < hualet> XD
11:30 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] felixonmars: prpr 猫
11:30 < felixonmars> hualet: np, i'm on irc and qq all day
11:30 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] 中午好呢
11:30 < felixonmars> @A2 hi
11:31 < hualet> felixonmars: ok
11:31 < felixonmars> @A2 python 3.5 rebuild 80%
11:31 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] Wow
11:32 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] 😏They can't understand Chinese
11:32 < x-iyzsong> ArchLinux 没有 ci 来 rebuild 么
11:33 < felixonmars> x-iyzsong: 有，没我手动快（大雾
11:33 < x-iyzsong> orz
11:33 < x-iyzsong> 土豪
11:33 < felixonmars> 自动的在这里：https://rebuilds.foutrelis.com
11:33 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] 😒You told me don't speak Chinese yesterday
11:34 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] 这有啥，才几个人说话自动适应一下就行（
11:35 < sbw> 好热闹 ˊ_>ˋ
12:24 < fasheng> hualet 之前的补丁因为不是 bugfix，放在最新分支比较好，但 2.3 还不太稳定，而且有 deepin-menu 和 fontconfig sefault 的问题，felixonmars 不如先不要移植 deepin-movie 了
12:25 < felixonmars> 好的……
12:30 < fasheng> felixonmars 开发者提示说 deepin-screenshoot 3.1 需要添加 qt5-svg 依赖，肥猫兄有空补上吧 :)
12:37 < felixonmars> 好的

19:56 < sbw> 为什么我们不用中文愉快的聊天呢
19:57 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] Because there are a lot of people aren't Chinese
