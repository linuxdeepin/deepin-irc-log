21:12 < arunpyasi> guys, I am just confused and wanted to know why there are not much activities in internet regarding Deepin ??
21:13 < hualet> arunpyasi: you know that kind of activities need professional skills
21:14 < hualet> arunpyasi: we do have marketing people, but they don't know much about open source
21:14 < arunpyasi> hualet, oh oh
21:14 < arunpyasi> hualet, thats the major problem :D
21:14 < hualet> arunpyasi: and of course we have people doing open source, but they don't know how to marketing
21:14 < arunpyasi> hualet, Why not you guys create a team for training those marketting people.
21:15 <@andy``> arunpyasi: China market is much different other country.
21:15 < arunpyasi> just for 1 week kinda... and ask to use Deepin compulsory :D and other Linux distros
21:15 < arunpyasi> ohh ohh
21:15 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] I think, becouse Deepin is made in China?
21:15 < arunpyasi> may be...
21:15 < arunpyasi> But Deepin Rocks
21:16 <@andy``> Most people of China don't know open source and free software.
21:16 < arunpyasi> are you guys selling Deepin to the industry and companies in China ?
21:16 < arunpyasi> ohh
21:16 <@andy``> arunpyasi: yes.
21:16 < arunpyasi> so, do they use Windows instead of linux ?
21:16 <@andy``> arunpyasi: yes.
21:16 < hualet> andy``: hello ;)
21:16 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] andy`` yes~
21:16 <@andy``> hualet: Robot is stuip
21:16 < arunpyasi> oops.. but I had heard that China is not using Windows anymore and Ubuntu is used...
21:16 <@andy``> And my English completion plugins is break now.
21:17 < hualet> andy``: arunpyasi called it a spy XD
21:17 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] And most Chinese don't know what is "copyright"
21:17 <@andy``> arunpyasi: China gov don't use any OS that develop by other country company.
21:17 < arunpyasi> andy``, ohh so, its not applied to the citizens right ?
21:17 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] yes~ only Chinese goverment
21:18 < arunpyasi> andy``, are you guys working on awareness programme ???
21:18 <@andy``> deepin-tgbridge: I hate you
21:18 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] Most Chinese use Windows
21:18 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] Why
21:18 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] I'm so cute OK
21:18 < arunpyasi> and making the laptop/hardware manufacturers and resellers to get Deepin pre-instaled ?
21:18 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] You can't hate me
21:19 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] I will sad
21:19 <@andy``> arunpyasi: We most sell Deepin OS to gov and company.
21:19 <@andy``> arunpyasi: But with open source way.
21:19 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] There is no manufacturers use Deepin~
21:20 <@andy``> We open all code (almost 5 million lines) with GPL3
21:20 < arunpyasi> andy``, ohh ohh, I think you guys should think of the citizens in China too except gov and companies..
21:20 < arunpyasi> andy``, ahh
21:20 <@andy``> arunpyasi: Of course.
21:20 <@andy``> arunpyasi: We have much citizens user in China.
21:21 <@andy``> And we have 65 language user in the world.
21:21 < arunpyasi> andy``, best idea to make everyone use Deepin instead of windows is my agreement with manufacturers to get Deepin preinstalled.
21:21 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] Wow~
21:21 <@andy``> deepin-tgbridge: Shutup
21:21 <@andy``> arunpyasi: China market is much different with US or other country.
21:21 < arunpyasi> and spread/conduct some awareness programme related OpenSource and Linux in place to place .. :D
21:22 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] nonono~ there are so much people use ms office~
21:22 < hualet> andy``: deepin-tgbridge is not a bot really
21:22 < arunpyasi> hehe here too...
21:22 <@andy``> Most computer preinstalled windows, because people don't know what is OS except Windows, and don't know how to use Linux.
21:22 < arunpyasi> everything is dominated by Windows. :(
21:22 < hualet> andy``: it bridge IRC and telegram
21:22 <@andy``> hualet: Ah?
21:22 < arunpyasi> andy``, same man
21:22 <@andy``> Sorry deepin-tgbridge
21:23 < arunpyasi> andy``, it looks like china and nepal market regarding windows and software is similar.
21:23 < hualet> andy``: so it's real person talking XD
21:23 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] Ah~ andy is so "萌"
21:23 < arunpyasi> Is heavy software piracy exist in China ???
21:23 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] I don't know how to speak 萌 in English~
21:23 <@andy``> arunpyasi: Yes
21:24 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] Yes~
21:24 < hualet> deepin-tgbridge: be careful, man, don't get kicked of by andy`` ;)
21:24 <@andy``> arunpyasi: Almost 90% software in China is piracy.
21:24 < hualet> deepin-tgbridge: that's easy, you are so "cute"
21:24 <@andy``> hualet: Wait, let me change to real me.
21:25 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] There are some different between 萌 and cute~
21:25 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] real you ?
21:25 < hualet> cute + stupid = 萌, I think, lol
21:25 < arunpyasi> ahh here is same man... everywhere software piracy exists.
