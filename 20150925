11:01 < deepin-bot> [fasheng]: test message from robot
11:02 < deepin-bot> [shibowen]:  balabala
11:05 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  hi   robots.  Do you know who am i?
11:05 < deepin-bot> [sbw]: test
11:05 < Choldrim> lol, I know...
11:17 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] Irc也有聊天bot啊……
11:19 < deepin-bot> [Iceyer]:  now, you know who am I?
11:19 < deepin-bot> [anonymous]: yes, irc3 bot
11:21 < Iceyer> maybe the bc username is not bad.
11:24 < Choldrim> hi deepin-tgbridge robot,  who r u? and who made u?
11:26 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] I'm not a robot😑
11:26 < helloworldlang> hi
11:27 < deepin-bot> [electricface]:  to irc
11:27 < deepin-bot> [electricface]: 123
11:29 < helloworldlang> 1 + 1 ?
11:29 < deepin-bot> [electricface]:  2
11:30 < deepin-bot> [anonymous]:  Gason Chiu, tgbridge, would u tell us what tg mean?
11:31 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] Telegram😂
11:33 < deepin-bot> [electricface]:  What is your organization？
11:36 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]: You seem to be quite a lot of people.  ;)
11:41 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] The info looks complex after reposted by two bots
11:44 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] Where is the info from reposted by deepin-bot？
11:45 < deepin-tgbridge> [Carlo] I don't know
11:47 < newname> d
11:49 < electricface> 不可
12:04 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] Chaney Zorn: #deepin on freenode
12:10 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] I get confused，the info not starts with nice name but the "deepin-bot" plus nice name
12:12 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] It not seems from IRC derictly but from other IM
12:12 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] 🌝讲中文啦
12:13 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 哈哈
12:13 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 我就是想问，为什么会有deepin-bot 前缀
12:14 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 因为到了telegram这里，会再有一个IRC bridge前缀
12:15 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 明显被deepin-bot 标记的信息不是直接来源于IRC
12:15 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] 说明那是另外一个 bot。。
12:15 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] 😂
12:17 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 😂所以我就好奇那个bot是沟通的哪两个软件
12:23 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] 王铭烨 Arthur2e5 的知乎主页 http://www.zhihu.com/people/2203e2e423bde9fd95b27ab643e42329
12:23 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] 咦 巧遇😂
12:25 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 咦，真巧～还是Arthur2e5更眼熟一点😂
12:26 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 不点开信息都不知道昵称😂
13:12 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  Hi, I'm andy from Deepin company, test message from bearychat (Deepin's company IM)
13:12 < andy``> Hmm, looks work!
13:20 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  arunpyasi: Say hi from bearychat. ;)
13:23 < arunpyasi> hi deepin-bot
13:23 < arunpyasi> hi manateelazycat :D
13:23 < arunpyasi> hi bearchat
13:23 < arunpyasi> who am I talking with ? :P
13:24 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  manateelazycat
13:24 < arunpyasi> cool
13:24 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  bearychat just IM of deepin company
13:24 < arunpyasi> who are you manateelazycat !
13:24 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  deepin-bot is bot that re-send message from bearychat to IRC.
13:24 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  Deepin developer
13:29 < arunpyasi> ohh ohh ok :D
13:29 < arunpyasi> which section of Deepin you work on ?
13:29 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  Almost everything . ;)
13:31 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] 我要看干脆面君😃
13:35 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] now I get it
15:45 < deepin-bot> [sbw]: >
17:44 < deepin-tgbridge> [Mingye Wang] 233 于是在 IRC 上把 tg 和 beary 连起来了吗
17:45 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 所以出现了双重桥～～～
17:45 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 要是再把telegram和beary连起来会怎么样？
17:45 < deepin-tgbridge> [Chaney Zorn] 😂会不会无线循环
17:46 < sbw> 会吧
17:52 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] Beary是啥
17:52 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  We have build double-channal between IRC and bearychat
17:54 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  I can see you guys' IRC message, and reply in bearychat directly
17:54 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  Gason Chiu: bearychat is IM used in Deepin, you can use it from bearychat.com
17:54 < Choldrim> beary  is bearychat
17:55 < deepin-tgbridge> [Gason Chiu] 看起来不错
17:55 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  bearychat is slack's chinese version, we can build manay robot in bearychat, such as, jenkis, gerrit, github, IRC, tower.im, mail etc.
17:55 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  Any Deepin people can reply IRC user's question, even he/she can't use IRC client.
17:56 < sbw> 😂test
17:56 < sbw> test2
17:57 < sbw> 😂
