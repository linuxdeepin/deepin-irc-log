03:14 < another_> how i can register acount for rate software in deepin store?
03:15 < another_> i can't understand chines
09:41 < fasheng> .tell another_ well, Deepin host a bot here, but when you asked the question, it's late at night in China. So why not post to the maillist. Just send email to deepinusers+subscribe@googlegroups.com to subscript it :P

10:57 < deepin-tgbridge> [BarryloveAmy *Lee] Fwd BarryloveAmy *Lee: 而美國人就可直接使用台基電的内件（軟件）?
10:57 < deepin-tgbridge> [BarryloveAmy *Lee] Fwd BarryloveAmy *Lee: 種族歧視嗎？
14:42 < arunpyasi> anyone from Deepin available now ?
14:42 < arunpyasi> deepin-bot: hello
14:43 < oahong> Do you have any issue with deepin?
14:49 < vodkode> heya guys
14:49 < vodkode> how are you
14:49 < vodkode> oahong deepin rocks
14:50 < vodkode> the coders should do more interviews and get the word out about Deepin more, in my opinion, its one of the top 3 distros made today and beats the hell out of ubuntu in terms of usability and modern look/feel
14:50 < vodkode> they just need to get people to use it and to learn who they are
14:51 < vodkode> a lot ignorance exists about deepin, people have the perception it is the Chinese only distrobution, or that it is made by the Chinese government, I have had to explain so many ignorant ideas away about it
14:51 < vodkode> I love the deepin but for some reason a lot of people have ignorant ideas
14:52 < x-iyzsong> vodkode: I agree some kind.  but I think we or Chinese tend to be shy :-)
14:52 < vodkode> same things I have had to explain away about WPS/Kingsoft office - the very best office suite for Linux, a lot of people see my systems and they see WPS and they ask 'oh how did you get that? I thought it was only in Chinese' and I explain to them its not, and show how much faster it is and better and they go 'ooo' but then they can't find it in the software center, so they think I hacked it, etc
14:53 < vodkode> x-iyzsong find someone in the west to act as a PR/Spokesman for it
14:53 < vodkode> that is the key
14:54 < vodkode> same thing all successful companies/groups do when they cross the world
14:54 < x-iyzsong> of course, Deepin is not related to the government.
14:55 < vodkode> x-iyzsong I know that, but a lot of people have ignorant ideas because they cannot find interviews and information about it - except from pundits/etc in the FOSS community or user reviews and half of those as unprofessional and don't speak from the source
14:55 < vodkode> you know what I mean?
14:55 < x-iyzsong> a Community Manager right?
14:55 < vodkode> yes
14:55 < vodkode> someone who can do youtube videos and explain who the coders are, what they did, how they designed it, etc
14:55 < vodkode> its such a great piece of software
14:55 < vodkode> it really should be promoted more
14:56 < vodkode> I would gladly pay 99.00 for every release of Deepin, my wife uses it every day now
14:56 < vodkode> I think for average people it is the best linux distro ever made, for average non-technical people who just want to use skype and do work
14:57 < x-iyzsong> that's a big praise, but I think Deepin is free, and always :-)
14:57 < vodkode> I know there are a lot of fans like me, who fully support it, but I found Deepin because I go onto distrowatch.com I research distros and I found it when I was looking for a distro that would be good for my wife to use and for my father who is in his 70's
14:58 < vodkode> I am a rare person though because I have been using *nix systems since I was a tiny kid in early 1990's
14:58 < fasheng> vodkode: thanks your option, Deepin employees will glade to hear that :)
14:59 < vodkode> The people who need to learn about Deepin and grow a userbase are average people, people who are non-system admins, just folks who want an OS for their computer that will not fail - and will look at it at face value and judge it for what it is, without arguing about some minor technical points
15:00 < vodkode> If you show deepin to 100 computer users here who use Windows, I think about 99 of them will say it looks better and that they would like to try it, it is easy enough that probably 75 of them would be able to install it without any problems, maybe 99 would, I don't know, but A LOT OF THEM would
15:01 < vodkode> The thing about Deepin, why it is special, why I think it has a huge potential, is because none of those users even need to know it is 'linux' they could use Deepin for 5 years and never have a clue it is 'Linux'
15:01 < vodkode> that is actually a big bonus
15:02 < vodkode> So, my advice, if you are part of Deepin, find a spokesperson who can do youtube videos, interviews and issue updates/information when you do releases of it, get the word out, you have tons of fans who support it
15:04 < vodkode> anyway keep up the good work on it, a lot of people really appreciate you guys and if any of the Deepin crew are ever in Florida, I would gladly buy you all drinks! you deserve it for the hard work you guys do
15:05 < x-iyzsong> yse, to be honesty, I don't think what you describe is done alrealy, Deepin it's still on the way. I did heard they have someone do the community or markting works though.
15:05 < vodkode> I think the problem Deepin is having is a very very common problem with products that cross the pacific
15:06 < x-iyzsong> marketing.. well, I don't have any idea about it :-
15:06 < vodkode> I lived in Makati Manila and I traveled in Asia a lot and I am also from the US and worked in business here my entire life, I see both sides a bit, its easy to get disconnected when you are working in 1 market and you are trying to penetrate another
15:07 < vodkode> The distributions that have been successful here, many of them are childish/amateur or even BAD by comparison to Deepin
15:09 < x-iyzsong> sure, differnt languages and cultures. I as a Chinese, can read English some kind and write poor sencences.  I think It will be a big win and cool to have co-workers over the world.
15:10 < vodkode> it is like the history of cars, for a long time in the 1970's and 80's people didn't know how much better a Toyota was compared to an American car, so they kept buying what they knew - American, then once Toyota got its marketing down, it became the No.1 brand for millions of people
15:11 < vodkode> Same story with Deepin in my opinion
15:11 < vodkode> if people see it, a refine interface that is comparable to OSX in refinement, a quality piece of software that runs properly and offers free applications for common computing, it will grow
15:12 < vodkode> I wonder if Deepin has ever considered maybe doing a crowdfunding campaign to offer a commercial distribution?
15:13 < vodkode> anyway, I love it, very happy it exists and excited about it
15:18 < x-iyzsong> vodkode: I don't know. And since I'm a kind of free-software person, I can't think of real benifits of commercial version over the community one.
15:23 < vodkode> x-iyzsong I am 100% for free software too
15:24 < vodkode> But my thinking is this - if Deepin was able to get big funding to have a commercial version, they could maybe rival canonical
15:24 < vodkode> they have advanced extremely far with relatively meager funding by comparison
15:25 < vodkode> I like to see projects like Deepin find commercial success so that they can stay around forever
15:25 < x-iyzsong> dunno, that's will be cool.
15:29 < x-iyzsong> I desired for it :-)  If you have some plans, I think you can reach them by email to 'support@linuxdeepin.com' or 'business@linuxdeepin.com'. I think they'll be very appreciate :-)
15:41 < vodkode> oh I don't want to bother them
15:41 < vodkode> :)
20:47 < arunpyasi> brainy: sir, Namaste
20:53 < brainy> namaste arunpyasi !
