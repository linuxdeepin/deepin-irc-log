04:02 < metak> hello felixonmars
17:33 < metak> hey fasheng
17:34 < fasheng> hi metak
17:34 < metak> how are you?
17:35 < fasheng> fine, just adjusting deepin package tags and architecture now
17:36 < metak> I saw that you changed back branch to release/3.0 for dde-workspace?
17:37 < fasheng> yes, dde-workspace is still used for osd and zone now
17:38 < metak> but that will conflict with others dde-desktop, dde-launcher... etc.?
17:39 < fasheng> 'osd' is the popup dialog when pressing volume button, and 'zone' is the ui that to change screen corner behavior
17:40 < fasheng> really? the latest code in  dde-workspace should not contain file for dde-desktop or dde-launcher. i will check it again later
17:40 < metak> that's why i changed it to remove branch...
17:42 < fasheng> i see
17:44 < metak> https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-workspace/blob/release/3.0/app/CMakeLists.txt
17:44 < metak> still builds dock and desktop...
17:44 < metak> https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-workspace/blob/remove/app/CMakeLists.txt
17:44 < metak> this one has all that disabled
17:48 < fasheng> well, you are right... please just switch it back to `remove` branch
17:52 < metak> should we also disable the guide? it just causes problems...
17:54 < fasheng> agree, disable dde-guide would be fine
17:58 < metak> fasheng, will dde-workspace remain in the future as a separate package?
18:01 < fasheng> no, maybe it will disappear in this week, and replaced by dde-session-ui
18:02 < metak> can it be replaced right now? I already made a dde-session-ui package...
18:08 < fasheng> it's ok, you can disable dde-workspace now, after dde-session-ui updated later(maybe one or two weeks), dde-osd and dde-zone will come back
18:09 < metak> yeah, no point wasting time on it since it's going to be removed soon anyway...
18:12 < metak> I'm asking you all this becuase the more I can remove from obs the happier I become... ;-)  seriously, it's such a pain in the arse to keep it all together in stupid obs... ;-)
18:13 < fasheng> haha ;)
18:17 < fasheng> metak: i'll leave for an hour, see you later
18:17 < metak> bye..
19:12 < felixonmars> :P
19:16 < metak> hey felix ;-)
19:16 < felixonmars> metak: hi :P
19:16 < felixonmars> i use a bouncer and always receive your message in the morning when you are offline :P
19:17 < metak> hehe
19:18 < metak> I just packaged deepin-sound-theme and making some other pkgbuilds...
19:19 < metak> what's next on your list to import?
19:23 < felixonmars> i'm waiting for the main dde packages now :P
19:24 < metak> since you'll be maintaining the packages I should ask you about deepin-icon-theme
19:25 < metak> it comes with default 'deepin' and old version 'deepin-2014'
19:26 < metak> i was wondering if it would even make sense to package the old one? (makefile builds them both)
19:28 < fasheng> metak: you mean deepin-sound-theme? well, i remember i just create this project hours ago. it's so magic!
19:29 < metak> yep fasheng... I saw, I packaged. ;-)
19:33 < metak> fasheng: any progress on why those *.so files are being installed to /usr/share/*?
19:35 < fasheng> dde-dock/dde-launcher/dde-session-ui/libdui/deepin-metacity/deepin-desktop-base(not porting required, but it owns the default background) synced to Github with tags now
19:40 < fasheng> metak: well, looks the developers didn't fix the path yet..
19:41 < fasheng> metak: i will submit patches for it
19:42 < metak> okay...
19:43 < metak> i'm currently updating pkgbuild files with new tags to make it easier for Felix to import...
19:45 < fasheng> great, thanks
19:46 < felixonmars> thanks :D
19:46 < felixonmars> :O deepin-metacity...
19:46 < felixonmars> i thought it's not needed :3
19:48 < fasheng> it's the flashback window manager for Deepin, maybe not necessary for archers..
19:51 < metak> felix have you seen my question above about deepin-icon-theme?
19:51 < felixonmars> oh, i may not build the old one if it's uneeded
19:54 < metak> it's not needed, it pulls faenza-icon-theme along... and I think it would be best to remove deepin-2014 and modify deepin.index file and change that Faenza inherits to something like adwaita or whatever... i believe faenza is completelly redundant
20:28  * s991533 Hello all!
20:37 < fasheng> hi s991533
20:46 < arunpyasi> hey s991533
20:46 < arunpyasi> how are you bro ?
20:46 < arunpyasi> hey hualet metak
20:46 < arunpyasi> how are you all guys ?
20:47 < hualet> arunpyasi: hi I'm fine ;)
20:48 < metak> hello arun ;)
20:51 < metak> fasheng: i removed deepin-2014 icon theme from deepin-icon-theme package and s/Faenza/Adwaita/ to avoid the having faenza when it's not needed. will it be OK that way?
20:54 < brainy> hi leaeasy
21:01 < fasheng> metak: looks will be fine, through it inherits from flattr and Faenza, Deepin-2015 just do not install Faenza and everything works fine
21:01 < zwitter__> wow
21:02 < zwitter__> today everyone in the home :D
21:02 < zwitter__> hualet: how is our OS going on ?
21:02 < zwitter__> when is it releasing the stable version ?
21:02 < brainy> hi hualet bro
21:03 < hualet> metak fasheng, I was asked to remove all the dependencies of Deepin icon theme
21:04 < hualet> zwitter__: we are hardly working on it XD
21:05 < zwitter__> hualet: cool brother
21:05 < zwitter__> hualet: bro, is there any deadline or something for the release?
21:05 < metak> hualet: so, is the deepin-icon-theme 'complete' now?
21:06 < zwitter__> is everything (development) actively sync to github ?
21:06 < hualet> zwitter__: you can go ask fasheng about the sync thing
21:07 < hualet> metak: I haven't done it yet, so I'm not sure about it
21:07 < hualet> metak: you're porting DDE too ?
21:07 < zwitter__> metak: you are also dev in deepin ?
21:08 < metak> zwitter__:no
21:08 < zwitter__> ok
21:08 < zwitter__> hualet: send me the iso file link before release OK !
21:08 < zwitter__> :D
21:08 < zwitter__> I will try and write an article on it :D hehe
21:09 < metak> hualet: i've been porting it with fasheng since he also started (for archlinux). ;-)
21:09 < fasheng> zwitter__: yes, most of the projects will sync to github and gitcafe in real time
21:10 < hualet> zwitter__: hmmm...that sounds OK with me, but not with our company and our marketing guys ;)
21:10 < zwitter__> hm.. :P
21:10 < zwitter__> ok !
21:11 < hualet> metak: that's you ?! cool man :)
21:11 < zwitter__> then, I will try to write after released :D
21:11 < hualet> zwitter__: write what?
21:11 < zwitter__> hualet: article on my blog. lol
21:12 < hualet> zwitter__: haha great
21:13 < zwitter__> man, you know which app I love most in deepin ?
21:13 < zwitter__> any guesses ??
21:14 < hualet> zwitter__: have you written something about Deepin before ?
21:14 < zwitter__> hualet: yeah
21:14 < zwitter__> I had
21:14 < hualet> can I see it ?
21:14 < zwitter__> http://linoxide.com/ubuntu-how-to/install-deepin-desktop-environment-derivatives-ubuntu/
21:14 < hualet> zwitter__: I guess it is deepin-music ?
21:15 < zwitter__> but this article is very small
21:15 < zwitter__> hualet: one is absolutely correct !
21:15 < zwitter__> I love deepin-music
21:15 < fasheng> metak: you could rebuild dde-control-center and dde-dock now, the *.so install path were fixed by upstream :)
21:15 < zwitter__> its really an awesome player man
21:15 < hualet> zwitter__: you're Chinese right?
21:15 < zwitter__> fasheng: are you the packager ?
21:15 < zwitter__> hualet: dude !!
21:16 < arunpyasi> hehe
21:16 < hualet> arunpyasi: are you kidding me
21:16 < arunpyasi> this nick comes when I get net reset

21:45 < arunpyasi> looks a good fork of deepin music
21:45 < arunpyasi> bro, is that only in chinese or also in english ?

21:49 < hualet> arunpyasi: gonna go, let's talk later :)
21:51 < fasheng> metak: how about the result?
22:00 < fasheng> well, the OBS building packages as slow as ever, i thinks see the result tomorrow is a good idea. bye felixonmars, bye all..
22:00 < felixonmars> ok..
22:11 < felixonmars> is qmusic going to follow deepin-music's changes?
