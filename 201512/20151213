22:50 < arunpyasi> but I am not getting how to clean this glass
22:50 < arunpyasi> I see everything cloudy !!
22:51 < brainy> Just clean with water first, then use a tissue or similar
22:58 < hualet> arunpyasi: hi :D
22:59 < hualet> I went to watch a movie called Point Break, have you guys seen it ?
23:01 < felixonmars> i wanted to watch a movie this morning, and unfortunately deepin-movie crashed...
23:01 < arunpyasi> brainy: ok brother
23:02 < arunpyasi> hualet: hi bro
23:02 < arunpyasi> hualet: how r u doing ?
23:02 < arunpyasi> hualet: I haven't watched it man !
23:02 < hualet> pathetic :(
23:02 < arunpyasi> how was it ?
23:02 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: hehe lol.
23:02 < hualet> felixonmars: have you debugged it ?
23:02 < arunpyasi> hualet: why bro, any problem ? is it due to deepin or something else ?
23:02 < felixonmars> hualet: still down to qtav, but qtav itself doesn't crash :/
23:03 < hualet> what ? that's insane
23:03 < hualet> qtav is in the same process
23:03 < hualet> oh I see
23:04 < hualet> you mean the qml part didn't work well with QtAV, right ?
23:05 < felixonmars> "[ShaderManager] cache a new shader material type(12): gl material 8bit channel: 0, planar: 0, has alpha: 1, 2d texture: 1"
23:05 < felixonmars> vdpau_video: VdpPresentationQueueTargetCreateX115): status 25: A catch-all error, used when no other error code applies.
23:05 < felixonmars> The program 'python2' received an X Window System error.
23:05 < felixonmars> something like this
23:06 < hualet> ah, it seems like the use of vdpau caused the crash
23:07 < felixonmars> yep
23:07 < hualet> felixonmars: which version are you using on Arch ?
23:07 < felixonmars> qtav 1.8.0.20151027-2
23:07 < felixonmars> deepin-movie 2.3.0.20151102-1
23:07 < felixonmars> A test video: https://paste.xinu.at/MR8Bir/
23:08 < felixonmars> QMLPlayer could play it just fine, while deepin-movie crashes
23:08 < hualet> that's strange
23:08 < felixonmars> and QMLPlayer is set to use VAAPI: http://i.imgur.com/Y8J9MDR.png
23:10 < hualet> wait, I remember that I didn't put VDPAU in the codecPriority list
23:10 < felixonmars> Full logs: https://paste.xinu.at/9A2TDr/
23:11 < hualet> which means it'll never use vdpau to decode the stream
23:11 < felixonmars> it's vaapi
23:11 < felixonmars> and libva calls vdpau
23:12 < hualet> ok...that makes sence
23:12 < felixonmars> it's still weird that QMLPlayer itself works just fine..
23:12 < felixonmars> (with the same codec setting)
23:13 < hualet> yeah
23:13 < hualet> I'm not on deepin right now, I'll debug it tomorrow
23:14 < felixonmars> sure
23:14 < felixonmars> just wait a moment, i'll extract logs from QMLPlayer for comparison
23:14 < hualet> the development of deepin-movie cease the right after the deepin 15 project was started, but not QtAV ...
23:14 < hualet> ok
23:15 < felixonmars> https://paste.xinu.at/hOP2y/
23:15 < felixonmars> it's literally the same, except that it didn't receive an X error...
23:16 < felixonmars> the 'Debug: sync config to  "/home/felix/.local/share/QMLPlayer/QMLPlayer.ini"' line appears when i close the window manually
23:17 < hualet> I used X11 functions in the development of deepin-movie, but QMLPlayer didn't
23:17 < felixonmars> i see :3 then it's fun for tomorrow :P
23:18 < hualet> :(
23:19 < hualet> how to put it in English "给自己擦擦屁股" ? ;) felixonmars
23:19 < felixonmars> clean up your own mess, or something similar?
23:21 < hualet> maybe "save my ass", hah
23:22 < felixonmars> (disclaimer: i didn't own copyright for that video, so be careful to download that if you are in a country caring this seriously)
23:23 < hualet> I think that disclaimer is just useless in China, mainland perhaps
23:23 < felixonmars> (sweet for our EU & US friends xD)
23:23  * arunpyasi is thinking to start coding :P
23:26 < arunpyasi> hualet: bro, have you guys ever compiled ffmpeg-php ?
23:26 < brainy> (see you later)
23:26 < hualet> arunpyasi: I didn't even know it before :D
23:27 < hualet> any problems ?
23:28 < hualet> arunpyasi: you can refer to felixonmars for some help, he may know ;)
23:29  * felixonmars is a sad pony that he's building qt5 again
23:29 < arunpyasi> hualet: yes bro, that shit is outdated and giving me problem to compile.. :P
23:29 < felixonmars> and chromium is still so messy with system-ffmpeg
23:29 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: you working on deepin-movie now bro ?
23:29 < arunpyasi> aahhh :P
23:29 < felixonmars> arunpyasi: nah, i worked on it before :P
23:30 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: bro, can you help me compile this shit out of the box ?
23:30 < arunpyasi> :P
23:30 < arunpyasi> needed for clipbucket
23:30 < felixonmars> for now i just confirm it still plays my ponies after a new package
23:30 < felixonmars> arunpyasi: so what's the problem currently?
23:31 < arunpyasi> configure: error: ffmpeg headers not found. Make sure ffmpeg is compiled as shared libraries using the --enable-shared option
23:31 < arunpyasi>  
23:31 < arunpyasi> while trying to compile bro
23:32 < arunpyasi> that error is from ./configure
23:32 < felixonmars> you have install ffmpeg headers?
23:32 < felixonmars> should be something like libavcodec-dev
23:32 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: yeah, I have installed ffmpeg and  ffmpeg-devel if its its header
23:32 < felixonmars> hrm, then you can check config.log for what exactly has failed
23:33 < felixonmars> and i am now building pandoc at the same time :/
23:35 < hualet> felixonmars: do you have certain packages to maintain or you should help each other ?
23:36 < felixonmars> hualet: i have 3k+ packages to maintain, and still helping others :P
23:36 < hualet> felixonmars: that's tons of work...
23:36 < felixonmars> the main package groups i maintain: Python, Perl, Haskell, Nodejs, KDE/Qt, Deepin, Chinese/Japanese l10n
23:36 < arunpyasi> wow !!!
23:36 < arunpyasi> amazing man !!!
23:36 < felixonmars> and many others that don't fit in
23:36 < hualet> that's incredible
23:37 < arunpyasi> you have skill on all those !!
23:37 < arunpyasi> simply, a genius !!!
23:37 < felixonmars> nah, i only know some of perl/haskell/nodejs/c++/go, and do only the packaging part mostly. i am only more experienced at python and always help upstream fix things
23:38 < hualet> felixonmars: I think I should meet you ASAP :D
23:38 < arunpyasi> hualet: yeah me too :D
23:38 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: bro, you live in China ?
23:38 < felixonmars> arunpyasi: sure, and same city as hualet
23:38 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: wow cool !
23:39 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: what you do for living bro ?
23:39 < felixonmars> writing python :3
23:39 < arunpyasi> felixonmars: cool :D you sell python apps !!
23:39 < felixonmars> also sysadmin/devops part
23:39 < felixonmars> nah, we are selling properties :P
23:40 < hualet> felixonmars: you should give me some instructions on systemd, LXC/docker, and package maintaining :D
23:40 < felixonmars> i mean real estate :3
23:40 < felixonmars> hualet: sure, i think i know them enough to use then in production environment already :3
23:40 < felixonmars> *use them
23:41 < hualet> definitely
23:41  * felixonmars is trying to use systemd-nspawn to replace docker in some context x.x
23:42 < arunpyasi> wow :D
23:42 < felixonmars> btw, we (arch) are always trying to enforce btrfs for official packaging
23:42 < hualet> felixonmars: why's that ?
23:43 < felixonmars> it's so much faster than rsyncing to create a clean chroot
23:43 < hualet> felixonmars: you mean use snapshots ?
23:43 < felixonmars> yay
23:45 < felixonmars> meh ns.zdnet.com.cn/ns1.zdnet.com.cn became NXDOMAIN and solidot.org failed to resolve
23:46 < felixonmars> what happened to them :/
23:47 < hualet> solidot.org is a copy of slashdot.com ?
23:48 < hualet> I didn't hear it before
23:48 < felixonmars> somewhat yes, a chinese copy
23:49 < hualet> ok
23:49 < felixonmars> https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/47358 would you consider to add a make option for this?
23:51 < felixonmars> (also i want comments about whether it actually works...)
23:51 < hualet> but I think it's not possible
23:52 < hualet> both deepin-notification and notify-osd are implementations of Gnome Desktop Notifications spec,
23:52 < hualet> so they provide the same dbus service...
23:56 < felixonmars> why did renaming sddm's service file work then :/
23:57 < felixonmars> (and that's org.freedesktop.DisplayManager.conf)
23:58 < hualet> felixonmars: maybe there are some tricks I didn't notice before
23:59 < hualet> I remember that the package that provides notification service for xfce4 can live with deepin-notifications
23:59 < felixonmars> yes
