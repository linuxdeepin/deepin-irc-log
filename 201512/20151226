00:04 < brainy> hi hualet man xD
00:05 < brainy> hualet, Do you work for Deepin ?
00:05 < hualet> hi brainy :D
00:05 < hualet> brainy: tonight ? no, I didn't work over time
00:06 < brainy> hualet, No , I mean in general. Did they offer you a job?
00:06 < brainy> Do you get paid working for Deepin
00:07 < hualet> I feel exhausted, so I took a break tonight :)
00:07 < hualet> brainy: Of course, or what do you think I was doing XD
00:07 < brainy> I think that working for a Linux distribution and getting paid is such a cool job!
00:08 < brainy> xD
00:08 < hualet> yeah, pretty much the same feeling with you
00:09 < brainy> dream job :D
00:09 < hualet> you know, I admire Netscape so much, sometimes I feel we too company share the same culture :D
00:09 < hualet> sorry, two
00:10 < brainy> Netscape??
00:10 < hualet> yeah, don't you think it's a great company ?
00:11 < brainy> I haven't heard about Netscape since they abandoned their browser? :D
00:11  * felixonmars whispers: time for some new tags!
00:12 < hualet> felixonmars: will do it tomorrow I think :/
00:12 < felixonmars> hualet: great :P
00:13 < felixonmars> i am in the mood for something new
00:13 < felixonmars> so either deepin or something else :3
00:13 < hualet> brainy: yeah, but it was a great company, right ?
00:13 < brainy> hualet, I think so. :D
00:14 < brainy> felixonmars is going for Deepin?? Great!
00:14 < hualet> nope, felixonmars still sells real estates :D
00:14 < brainy> loool hualet
00:15 < hualet> felixonmars can you tell us about your business model ? or it's secret ?
00:15 < felixonmars> nah, just sell it
00:16 < felixonmars> and always do something different, start from smaller things
00:17 < hualet> felixonmars: sounds quite easy :/ can I do it ? XD
00:18 < brainy> :D
00:18 < felixonmars> sure you can
00:19 < hualet> haha, just kidding :D
00:19 < felixonmars> :3
00:19 < hualet> what do you do at weekends ?
00:20 < felixonmars> prepare some packages, try something new, go out and find something (new) to eat, etc
00:21 < felixonmars> mer/nemo is also in my list of packaging :P
00:21 < hualet> and what's that ?
00:22 < felixonmars> http://www.merproject.org/
00:24 < hualet> I see MeeGo and Tizen :D
00:24 < brainy> Meego has been long dead :(
00:25 < felixonmars> yep
00:25 < hualet> geek stuff, I don't understand XD
00:25 < brainy> lol
00:26 < felixonmars> https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/fingerterm/
00:26 < hualet> felixonmars is a geek, I'm not, and you ? brainy
00:26 < felixonmars> i actually have "ported" some parts
00:26 < felixonmars> just like what i did when i began to "port" deepin here
00:27 < felixonmars> the individual apps are definitely easier to begin with :P
00:27 < felixonmars> hualet: you are geek man :3
00:29 < hualet> no, I sometimes really want to simply enjoy the time playing with a computer, not poking around
00:29 < hualet> for programming, reading source code or something like that :(
00:30 < felixonmars> yeah i have enough time for that too
00:30 < brainy> programming is playing around with a computer? :D
00:31 < hualet> no, I mean I don't always want to create software, I also want to enjoy softwares written by other great programmers :D
00:32 < felixonmars> sure
00:32 < brainy> Exactly hualet , I hear you
00:33 < felixonmars> and i just do it in an insaner way...
00:33 < hualet> x_x
00:34 < felixonmars> i often try to create a proper package for something before try it...
00:35 < hualet> it's like a black hole, nothing will fill it...
00:35 < felixonmars> sure, so i just repeat and find more interesting stuff :P
00:35 < hualet> :D
00:36 < hualet> here's a question for you XD
00:36 < brainy> felixonmars, how many packages do you have on your PC? :D
00:36 < hualet> which editor do you use ? vim or emacs ?
00:36 < felixonmars> brainy: 3723 atm
00:36 < brainy> wow
00:37 < hualet> wow
00:37 < felixonmars> hualet: vim, nano, sublime-text, atom, leafpad, ...
00:37 < hualet> so you should try a new editor, like emacs
00:38 < felixonmars> brainy: and it's not the peak, since i uninstalled the whole haskell stack today
00:38 < felixonmars> used to be 100+ more
00:38 < felixonmars> hualet: yep, on my list already :P
00:39 < felixonmars> i'm already confused enough to use emacs-style hotkeys for readline and vi-mode in fish...
00:40 < felixonmars> so really, time for something new...
00:40 < hualet> sometimes I see emacs the same way I see linux, once you are in, you never stop untill you're exhausted and quit XD
00:40 < felixonmars> i hardly do that xD
00:40 < felixonmars> except Arch and pacman x.x
00:41 < felixonmars> even linux is not like this - i also package for msys2
00:41 < hualet> oh god ...
00:42 < felixonmars> (but not really like their packaging style... so "fork msys2" is also on my list xD
00:42 < hualet> what's going on in your dumb head XD
00:43 < felixonmars> msys2's goal is to merge back with cygwin, and mine is different.
00:43 < felixonmars> i want to support wine as multilib
00:44 < felixonmars> hualet: :P
00:44 < hualet> huh ? why would cygwin users need wine ?
00:44 < felixonmars> they don't. they can use everything there except wine
00:45 < felixonmars> and i can provide a single binary repository for both platforms
00:46 < hualet> XD
00:46 < felixonmars> but that's really long story. for now we need quite a lot of work to be done beforehand
00:47 < hualet> have you arch developers met each other offline ?
00:47 < felixonmars> some of them have. i didn't yet
00:47 < hualet> you are the youngest developer ?
00:48 < felixonmars> our donation is at an awkward level, which is too much for our servers and infrastructure, and not enough for some offline meetups...
00:48 < felixonmars> hualet: no i'm not
00:48 < felixonmars> maybe 3rd or 4th
00:49 < felixonmars> the youngest guy was born in 1994
00:50 < hualet> wow...then I understand why you guys built the subtitle search engine you showed me the other night :D
00:51 < felixonmars> the author of that search engine was born in 1989 :P
00:51 < hualet> I'm curious who is the oldest ?
00:52 < felixonmars> well, our emails in private list often begin with "hi everypony..."
00:52 < felixonmars> hualet: should be Giovanni Scafora from 1969
00:52 < felixonmars> and we have some 197x guys
00:53 < hualet> everypony...
00:54 < hualet> you guys are all genius XD
00:55 < felixonmars> we also have quite some anime/game topics every day
00:56 < felixonmars> last year we have nearly everything delayed for ~1month, because like half of the team happened to play dota 2 too much addicted...
00:57 < felixonmars> and this month... let's see how much will one punch man delay...
00:59 < hualet> hmmm... I like these anecdotes :D
00:59 < felixonmars> xD
00:59 < felixonmars> and if i broke nvidia again, it will speed up the packaging work significantly...
00:59 < hualet> haha. lol
01:00 < felixonmars> o/
01:00 < hualet> I don't play dota 2, I play LOL instead :D
01:00 < felixonmars> they look similar to me though, since i play neither
01:01 < hualet> it's much easier
01:01 < felixonmars> i se...
01:01 < felixonmars> oh, and one 197x-born guy always join the anime discussion and recommend his favorites
01:02 < felixonmars> no generation gap here - i think i just see a good dad xD
01:02 < hualet> haha, interesting people
01:04 < hualet> almost lost consciousness, gotta to sleep for a while
01:04 < hualet> see you felixonmars brainy :D
01:05 < felixonmars> bye :P i have to sleep too, for tomorrow's work :3
01:05 < hualet> OK
01:05 < hualet> good night then
01:05 < felixonmars> good night :3
10:23  * hualet thinking 
10:46 < felixonmars> hualet: :3 thinking what?
10:46 < felixonmars> like... name for the new tags?
10:47 < hualet> I realized that we can't do it right now, translations are not merged into code base yet :(
10:48 < hualet> fasheng: what do you think ?
10:51 < hualet> also I think we should jump all the version numbers to 3.0 if possible
10:54 < felixonmars> you also have 1.x and 15.x
11:10 < hualet> I said "if possible" XD
11:17 < fasheng> hualet: ok, let's wait for the translationss merged. how long it will takes then?
11:19 < felixonmars> :3
11:22 < hualet> next Monday :D
11:25 < fasheng> that's fine
11:25 < hualet> it's not fine, it's just OK, don't forget the release date :(
11:26 < hualet> and I still want to ensure the quality
11:26 < hualet> frustrating :(
11:28 < felixonmars> release early, release often. - eric s. raymond
11:28  * felixonmars runs
11:29 < hualet> good point, thanks for your comfort felixonmars :/
11:29 < felixonmars> xD
11:30 < hualet> I didn't even know the it's Raymond's quote
11:30 < hualet> I heard it from a speech by Audrey Tang
11:30 < felixonmars> it's in his famous book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
11:30 < hualet> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqKwc4bcOhI
11:31 < hualet> I haven't read it
11:31 < felixonmars> xD you should read it, i think
11:31 < hualet> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6bBcvSyg0k this one is better :D
11:31 < hualet> felixonmars: and I think you should watch the video XD
11:32 < felixonmars> sure i will do :3
11:32 < hualet> XD
23:03 < brainy> hi hualet xD
23:03 < hualet> hi brainy
23:04 < brainy> hualet, is there any christmas celebration in China?
23:05 < hualet> mostly young people celebrate
23:06 < hualet> and also there're discount in malls
23:06 < hualet> how do you celebrate Christmas ? brainy
23:10 < brainy> hualet, we just have some dinner, thats it xD
23:12 < hualet> you don't go buy something, I mean no discounts going on ?
23:12 < brainy> hmmm not much hualet
23:13 < brainy> hualet, do you have a day in the week when shops are closed, like sundays in the west?
23:13 < brainy> sorry for my ignorance xD
23:14 < hualet> shops are closed ? no ! merchants in China like holidays XD
23:14 < brainy> I don't even know if shops are open on sundays in the USA, maybe vodkode can tell us
23:14 < brainy> lol hualet nice
23:16 < brainy> hualet, they used to sell Suse Linux in the stores here when the Linux hype was alive, later Ubuntu, now I don't see any Linuy in the stores anymore :(
23:16 < brainy> Seems like people were not interested or they simply downloaded it
23:17 < brainy> I bought the Suse Linux once just to support them but when I tried to install it, it didn't work :(
23:17 < hualet> I think it's because the network is much better than ever, people just download them at home
23:17 < brainy> hualet, why I am saying this, I am thinking about Deepin in Chinese stores :D
23:18 < brainy> true hualet
23:18 < hualet> brainy: so you switched to deepin XD
23:18 < brainy> yes lol
23:18 < hualet> no, definitely not
23:19 < hualet> Chinese individual users never get used to pay for softwares
23:19 < brainy> Oh I heard about that, you are right
23:20 < hualet> but some programmers do pay for softwares :D
23:21 < brainy> thats nice :D
23:21 < brainy> programming is such a hard work
23:21 < brainy> many people dont appreciate it
23:22 < hualet> yes, many programmers are labeled by their family members as "man can fix computer " XD
23:24 < brainy> lol
23:25 < brainy> I love those questions, I used to get them all the time
23:25 < brainy> they said: "I heard you are good with computers, could you fix my PC please??"
23:45 < brainy> hi xiaoxing
23:47 < xiaoxing> hi
