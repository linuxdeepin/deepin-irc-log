01:06 < jack> Hi !
01:07 < Guest96375> Can someone help me with the deepin installer ?
09:07 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  Guest96375: what's wrong? If you can speak English you can issue the problem in http://bbs.deepin.org.
20:39 < brainy> hello hualet_deepin bro
20:39 < hualet_deepin> brainy: hi
20:39 < felixonmars> hiho
20:39 < felixonmars> where was "language_info.json" used?
20:40 < hualet_deepin> where did you find it :P
20:40 < felixonmars> in latest deepin-desktop-base
20:42 < hualet_deepin> I don't know, maybe dde-first-run or maybe deepin-installer
20:42 < felixonmars> i see... neither is related to arch-deepin, so i'll forget it :P
20:42 < hualet_deepin> what's wrong ?
20:43 < hualet_deepin> :/
20:43 < felixonmars> i'm waiting for shiny new tags being synced to github
20:46 < hualet_deepin> fasheng have already done it :D
20:46 < felixonmars> nah, it's not there yet...
20:46 < felixonmars> (the syncing seems stopped 2 hours ago)
20:47 < hualet_deepin> so stay tuned
20:47 < felixonmars> :P
20:47 < hualet_deepin> :D
20:47 < felixonmars> i've prepared all the pkgbuilds...
20:48 < hualet_deepin> so you'll spend all the night building the new packages, huh ?
20:48 < felixonmars> nah, it's not that slow...
20:48 < felixonmars> and i have three machines to queue the builds anyway :P
20:50 < hualet_deepin> so how long will it take to build all the stuff ?
20:53 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: < 1h, iirc
20:54 < hualet_deepin> wow, that's amazing :D
20:55 < felixonmars> xD
20:55 < felixonmars> yay tldr is on homepage of HN https://twitter.com/newsycombinator/status/681445138145619968
21:03 < hualet_deepin> a better man ?
21:08 < felixonmars> a lazy man's man
21:08 < felixonmars> xD
21:09 < hualet_deepin> I don't see the potential, you do ?
21:09 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  tldr is too slow
21:10 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  But the idea is very cool
21:11 < felixonmars> well, it has local cache now
21:11 < felixonmars> (not for the python client yet, my fault :3)
21:14 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  Which client support cache ?  I only used golang version.
21:15 < felixonmars> the nodejs client should be better maintained
21:16 < hualet_deepin> ah, now I see a command line wikipedia :P
21:18 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  hualet_deepin: XIAOHUOZI what are you saying
21:19 < felixonmars> o/
21:19 < hualet_deepin> I need to clone the repository ? felixonmars snyh ?
21:20 < felixonmars> which one?
21:20 < felixonmars> if you mean tldr, try instructions here: https://tldr-pages.github.io/
21:22 < hualet_deepin> I installed the python client, but it wanted a repo_directory
21:24 < hualet_deepin> I checked tldr update just called 'git rev-parse master'
21:27 < felixonmars> yep
21:27 < felixonmars> that's the old way...
21:27 < felixonmars> and i was too lazy to update the python client x.x
21:31 < hualet_deepin> it gets me to know the details, and I enjoy it :P
21:31 < felixonmars> xD
21:43 < brainy> good job hualet_deepin and felixonmars
21:44 < hualet_deepin> brainy: I thought you were asleep :D
21:44 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: he's waiting for the shiny new version!
21:44  * felixonmars too
21:45 < brainy> lol
21:45 < brainy> true
21:46 < hualet_deepin> well, our mutual friend is busy building the ISO
21:49 < brainy> hualet_deepin, That's great news xD
21:53 < brainy> I wonder if s991533_ will try the new version
22:02 < hualet_deepin> s991533_ never came back :(
22:04 < brainy> :((
22:15 < felixonmars> let's induce him to use arch and install deepin for him :3
22:20 < brainy> xD
22:35 < deepin-bot> [fasheng]:  felixonmars: i really have no idea for the gerrit sync issue now, please wait for our system maintainer to solve it ~
22:35 < felixonmars> ok...
22:44  * felixonmars could really help sync the repos, if that's useful...
22:44 < felixonmars> i do syncs for arch already xD
23:14 < brainy> welcome back s991533_
23:14 < brainy> So when is the big day, guys ??
23:18 < brainy> felixonmars, I know you are hiding the ISO somewhere :P
23:24 < felixonmars> brainy: not me!
23:24 < brainy> xd
23:25 < felixonmars> i don't work for deepin (yet) xD
23:27 < s991533_> :/
23:29 < brainy> s991533_ is here !!!
23:29 < brainy> hualet_deepin, wake up
23:30 < hualet_deepin> hi s991533_ , welcome back :D
23:30 < hualet_deepin> I'm still working, man, not asleep :(
23:31 < felixonmars> and i'm still stucked...
