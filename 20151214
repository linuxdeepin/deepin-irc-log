00:00 < hualet> well... I'll try to figure it out
00:00 < felixonmars> thanks :)
00:01 < hualet> felixonmars: why don't you just ask lazycat to create a project on tower for you and fasheng to track porting issues
00:02 < hualet> we are so rely on Tower to "remember" things ;)
00:02 < felixonmars> i think github is more friendly to users, and currently fasheng should be handling the sync job :3
00:03  * felixonmars sometimes what commits and close issues, too
00:03 < felixonmars> *watch
00:03 < hualet> ok
00:04 < hualet> gotta go to sleep, good night, felixonmars :D
00:04 < felixonmars> hualet: also there are really few issues that are related to porting only
00:04 < felixonmars> i think fasheng gave up on marking issues as "upstream" when he realized they are mostly so :P
00:05 < felixonmars> hualet: good night :P
00:06 < hualet> XD
00:28 < arunpyasi> all slept !!
02:57 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  felixonmars: I have fixed clutter clone issue, you can play mrkeyboard under deepin-metacity, deepin-wm has a bug that mrkeyboard can't work.
02:57 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  felixonmars: Read README.md to install mrkeyboard, happy hacking! ;)
06:15 < CountryfiedLinux> howdy
06:15 < CountryfiedLinux> Has the repository been fixed yet?
06:15 < CountryfiedLinux> I used Deepin for a short period of time but switched back to Arch after the repos got really slow.
07:20 < vodkode> you can switch repos now
07:20 < vodkode> its been a while since they were static
07:21 < CountryfiedLinux> ok cool thanks vodkode
09:07 < felixonmars> manateelazycat: great, i'll try :P
12:28 < hualet_deepin> hi, felixonmars
12:29 < hualet_deepin> I've found that the dbus service activation has nothing to do with the service file name, so I've changed the service file name provided by deepin-notifications.
12:31 < hualet_deepin> you should have been informed by gerrit that I also add you as a reviewer.
13:33 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: great, thanks :)
13:35 < hualet_deepin> felixonmars: plz check the my comment there
13:43 < felixonmars> +1
13:44 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: i mean, a config option to rename would be better :3
13:44 < felixonmars> or i could do it myself...
13:45 < felixonmars> currently we have to live with the situation to support co-installation
13:49 < hualet_deepin> felixonmars: and why's that if I may ask :)
13:50 < felixonmars> we made it upstream for sddm before :Phttps://github.com/sddm/sddm/wiki/0.12.0-Release-Announcement
13:56 < hualet_deepin> felixonmars: I mean why should you make sure that deepin-notifications can co-exist with notify-osd ?
13:58 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: that's a downstream way of approach this problem currently. i am trying to convince others to reconsider this, but it needs some time
14:00 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: hrm, i find something interesting: https://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/
14:03 < felixonmars> ideally we want to make DEs co-installable as possible, and want to stop deepin-notification being affecting other DEs
14:04 < hualet_deepin> felixonmars: ah, I finally get your point.
14:05 < felixonmars> lemme guess - if something like dde-session-daemon could register itself on org.freedesktop.Notification if possible, and call deepin-notification, maybe the service file is no longer needed?
14:12 < felixonmars> or maybe a daemon like lxqt-notificationd...
14:25 < felixonmars> (just asked someone using plasma 5, the service is owned by plasmashell itself there.)
14:32 < hualet_deepin> felixonmars: sorry for not answering, I know what do you mean.
14:33 < felixonmars> hualet_deepin: np :P
14:33 < hualet_deepin> the name changing is not a big deal, I just want to follow the standard :D
14:33 < felixonmars> i know, and i want to avoid that file altogether :P
14:34 < hualet_deepin> I understand
14:37 < hualet_deepin> I've +1, let's see how snyh react :P
14:39 < felixonmars> :P
16:44 < felixonmars> fasheng: hi, where was go-gir-generator used?
16:53 < fasheng> go-gir-generator was used to generate go-dlib/{glib,gio,gobject}. The upstream is changing it now to fix the architecture issue(x86_64, i686, etc). And arch-deepin should follow the changes, too.
16:53 < felixonmars> ok
16:54 < fasheng> I will sync the code to github later...
16:54 < felixonmars> thanks :)
17:03 < fasheng> felixonmars: Here it is https://github.com/linuxdeepin/go-gir-generator. Usage: `make; cd lib.in; make`, then use the generated code instead of the old go-dlib/{glib,gio,gobject}. Looks it's ready for arch-deepin now, you could have a try :P
17:11 < felixonmars> fasheng: should i remove the corresponding folders in go-dlib, and copy the new code there?
17:11 < felixonmars> fasheng: would go-lib be updated to remove the folders?
17:14 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  felixonmars:  wait a moment .  gir-generator is still adjusting.
17:14 < fasheng> felixonmars: yes, we will. but the guys plan to use symlinks to make the changes works smoothly. so maybe we still need do some hacks.
17:14 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:   It should be ok in two days
17:15 < fasheng> felixonmars: OK, let's wait for it ready~
17:16 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  it seems I need update the README for gir-geneartor
17:18 < felixonmars> ok, thanks :3
19:35 < brainy> hi fasheng
19:35 < fasheng> hi, brainy-
20:09 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]: hi, fasheng üòÅ
21:44 < felixonmars> fasheng: :/ gerrit returns 502 now
21:45 < fasheng> oh, maybe someone reboot the server now~
21:50 < felixonmars> and it's empty now x.x
22:01 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]: felixonmars: gerrit is under maintenance now, wait a monment
22:02 < felixonmars> ok, not in a hurry :P
22:02 < felixonmars> just in case you didn't know yet...
23:00 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]: felixonmars: gerrit is ok now, thinks for your reminding ;)
23:01 < felixonmars> np, now i'm submitting another patch :P
23:27 < felixonmars> choldrim: gerrit still doesn't work smoothly :P for example, when clicking deepin-icon-theme on this page: https://cr.deepin.io/#/admin/projects/?filter=icon
23:27 < felixonmars> it returns two 500 Internal server error
23:28 < felixonmars> fasheng: ^
23:30 < fasheng> thanks, will check it later
23:57 < fasheng> felixonmars: it works now‚Ä¶
