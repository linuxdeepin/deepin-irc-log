00:39  * s991533 ha ...
09:52 < hualet> felixonmars: hi what did you do yesterday dude ?
09:53 < hualet> I called you but you didn't answer it :(
10:15 < felixonmars> hualet: ah, i was having some family trouble :3
10:16 < hualet> OK, we had hotspot for launch :D
10:17 < felixonmars> hrm, wifi hotspot or java hotspot? xD
10:17 < hualet> hotpot, sorry XD
10:18 < felixonmars> o/ ah, i shouldn't have missed that...
10:18 < hualet> yep
10:19 < felixonmars> any new tags to celebrate the hotpot? xD
10:19 < hualet> and we also had pedicure, it feels good :D
10:20 < felixonmars> :O
10:20 < felixonmars> not "great" cure?
10:20 < hualet> felixonmars: ah, you can imagine that :P
10:21 < felixonmars> xD
10:21 < hualet> so, anything great to share with me ?
10:23 < felixonmars> like wine 1.9.1 adds "api-ms-win-security-lsalookup-l1-1-1.dll.so"? xD
10:24 < felixonmars> but seriously, the new nvidia beta driver is having too many problems that i do not suggest to bump...
10:25 < hualet> I'm not sure if debian has updated it to beta
10:25 < felixonmars> it breaks Qt5 badly, crashes sddm/deepin-notification/dde-osd/... on startup, and also breaks primus
10:26 < hualet> ah...so it's not dde/deepin-*'s fault to break then XD
10:26 < hualet> s/break/crash sorry
10:27 < felixonmars> it's a hard choice though, because it also fixes lock issues under Skylake family
10:28 < hualet> what will you do ?
10:28 < felixonmars> now the best possible result is to binary patch 358 drivers for Skylake family. it is against the EULA iirc, so users will have to do that manually
10:29 < hualet> binary patch ?
10:29 < felixonmars> as someone pointed out: "In libEGL_nvidia.so.0 (md5sum 36a6edacefcd2893b3bc5c6c282943b6), replace  bytes "e8 64 d3 f8 ff" @ offset 0x95987 with "90 90 90 90 90".
10:30 < felixonmars> this will fix 358 driver for the new cpus
10:31 < hualet> sounds not user friendly
10:31 < felixonmars> xD yeah
10:31 < felixonmars> up to nvidia to fix their blob :/
10:31 < hualet> you've done that kind of binary patch before ?
10:31 < felixonmars> ye, i did...
10:31 < hualet> great you
10:31 < hualet> lol
10:32 < felixonmars> o/
10:32 < hualet> you've reported the issue ?
10:32 < felixonmars> many users have...
10:33 < felixonmars> and nvidia ignored it for ~5 months already
10:33 < hualet> any office answers from nvidia ?
10:33 < hualet> ah...
10:34 < felixonmars> i don't have such new cpu myself, though xD
10:36 < hualet> I don't even know what CPU I've got on the x230 laptop XD
10:36 < felixonmars> should be something like core i5 :3
10:36 < hualet> the other day I found that my laptop supports wake-on-lan :D
10:37 < hualet> you reminds me, it's i7 XD
10:37 < felixonmars> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylake_%28microarchitecture%29
10:37 < felixonmars> should be only affecting very new laptops
10:39 < hualet> it's ready for sale ?
10:40 < hualet> the wiki says it's been launched on August 2015
10:45 < felixonmars> yeah, there are some iirc
10:45 < felixonmars> at least we got waves of angry users on the bug tracker xD
10:48 < hualet> haha, I hope deepin can share some waves of angry users from you guys XD
10:50 < felixonmars> o/

22:39 < hualet> maybe...
22:39 < brainy> hualet, who inspires you more, Linus Thorvalds or Steve Jobs? :D
22:41 < hualet> brainy: I don't get much inspiration from Linus, I have to say :D
22:42 < hualet> but Steve Jobs seduced me to this industry XD
22:42 < hualet> a book about Jobs I mean
22:45 < brainy> haha ok, poor Linus
22:45 < brainy> But Linus said "Fuck you nvidia"  xD
22:46 < brainy> So he is a top player
22:46 < hualet> that's not what I mean, I respect Linus much and I like him, but he did not inspire me much.
22:46 < brainy> ok man :D
22:46 < hualet> haha, he's sort of cool :D
22:48 < hualet> I'm enlightened by three programmer : Jamie Zawinskie, Aaron Swartz, and Audrey Tang :D

23:03 < brainy> At which underground station are the Deepin headquarters? :D
23:23 < hualet> brainy: we're a bit far away from the central of Wuhan city, so there's no station around us for now
23:24 < brainy> ok hualet
