21:36 < deepin-bot> [sbw]:  not yet
21:36 < Rosen> but is it possible to change keyboard layout to Bulgarian BDS, instead of Bulgarian Phonetic ?
21:39 < sbw> you can change keyboard in control center, but i dont know does there have your keyboard layout
21:40 < Rosen> so bulgarian bds not available
21:40 < Rosen> only phonetic
21:40 < Rosen> but i need BDS
21:40 < Rosen> so any another way to get BDS ?
21:40 < Rosen> some config file edit ?
21:41 < sbw> oh, im not sure, but i can help u to report this issue.
21:44 < hualet> Rosen: still there ?
22:25 < Rosen> yes
22:25 < Rosen> hualet: i am here
22:25 < hualet> Rosen: welcome back
22:26 < hualet> the guy who maintains the keyboard layout is not here now, I'll let him know tomorrow morning :D
22:27 < hualet> keyboard layout module of dde-control-center, I mean
22:27 < Rosen> well
22:28 < Rosen> so about another questions
22:28 < Rosen> is it possible to have icons on desktop
22:28 < hualet> of course you can
22:28 < Rosen> is it possible setting for hidpi display
22:29 < hualet> Our DE is not ready for high-dpi yet sadly
22:29 < hualet> so it's not
22:29 < hualet> Rosen: other questions ?
22:30 < Rosen> for now no
22:30 < Rosen> just for desktop icons
22:30 < Rosen> how to enable them
22:30 < Rosen> to be visible home folder
22:31 < hualet> Rosen: when you say 'desktop icons' you mean the "Computer" and "Trash" icon ?
22:31 < Rosen> computer trash home and etc
22:32 < hualet> try to switch your Dock to classic mode or efficient mode
22:32 < hualet> that will bring the icons back to your desktop
22:33 < hualet> but it's not possible to show them while Dock is in fashion mode for now, we'll change this behavior soon in the future
22:37 < Rosen> [   10.518160] wl: module license 'MIXED/Proprietary' taints kernel.
22:37 < Rosen> what is that module wl ?
22:37 < Rosen> is it releated to rtl8723be ?
22:39 < hualet> Rosen: maybe, I'm not sure about that
22:40 < hualet> you installed the proprietary driver ?
22:40 < Rosen> no
22:41 < Rosen> just asking because this is different than in ubuntu and debian
22:41 < Rosen> where i have troubles with connection
22:41 < Rosen> but with deepin connection is stable..
22:43 < hualet> I bet that you installed the corresponding proprietary driver, you just didn't notice :D
22:44 < Rosen> hm i do fresh install
22:44 < Rosen> and only installed by me skype vlc firefox
22:47 < hualet> OK... :/
22:51 < Rosen> thanks for info and help. meybe in future time i will use again deepin linux.
22:51 < Rosen> its nice
22:51 < Rosen> but i have to wait some of this issues and features to be done
22:52 < hualet> hi bobo___
22:53 < hualet> Rosen: OK, just make your choice :D
22:54 < bobo___> Hi hualet
23:08 < Rosen> so my choice is clear i just will wait for this features
