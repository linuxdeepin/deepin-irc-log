09:38 < brainy> I can affirm that you are indeed back.

09:39 < edmund__> Hello Brainy
09:39 < edmund__> Cool
09:42 < brainy> edmund__, what's the latest Linux book you've been reading?
09:44 < edmund__> I am reading some online stuffs about linux kernel
09:45 < brainy> cool man, pretty complicated stuff
09:46 < edmund__> My previous research was about time-triggered system. I thought if it's possible to implement it in linux kernel.
09:49 < brainy> Sounds interesting, what exactly is it you want to do?
09:52 < edmund__> Am still researhing it.
09:53 < brainy_> Sorry, got disconnected.
09:53 < edmund__> No problem mate
09:55 < edmund__> The main difference from time-triggered system is the way of implementing scheduling strategy
09:56 < edmund__> Actually the task is scheduled based on time slice
09:57 < brainy_> Yes I see
10:00 < edmund__> we both got very unstable connection
10:02 < brainy> Yeah
10:02 < brainy> I'm not sure if it's my DSL connection or the connection to this server
