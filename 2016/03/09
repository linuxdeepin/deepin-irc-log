00:10 < steev> can whoever made the nanopi2 image remake it with a newer kernel?  The nanopi2 fire is out now, and you have to use a different kernel branch to support both the nanopi2 and the nanopi2 fire
00:13 < ohms360> i think i might have discovered a bug
00:16 < ohms360> seems the launcher doesn't play too nicely with dual screen setups and displays slap bang in the middle of both instead of just the primary monitor (it's hard to read!)
00:20 < xor_> hi
00:20 < jotapesse> ohms360: my launcher only displays in primary screen
00:21 < xor_> i have a problem using deepin. The side panel is stuck and overrlaps my windows and everything
00:21 < xor_> can i reset it somehow?
00:22 < jotapesse> ohms360: the only issue i've found is with the dock calendar popup that splits across both screens
00:22 < xor_> ah i can smell it now too
00:22 < xor_> because it is burning up my one of my cpus
00:23 < jotapesse> xor: you may try to kill dde-control-center in termianl and restart it?
00:27 < ohms360> jotapesse: maybe there's something yet to update on my system, we shall find out soon :)
00:27 < xor_> @jotapesse: i killed it indeed. I could find the process by its cpu usage. it restarted by itself
00:27 < xor_> thanks
00:29 < xor_> when I try to use the launcher to start a program on the computer, another process called deepin-osd starts eating 76% CPU and the program does not start.
00:29 < xor_> I think that is what crashed the dde-control-center
00:29 < xor_> jotapesse do u know where i can find log files of this ?
00:31 < jotapesse> xor: no idea
00:32 < ohms360> jotapesse: seems an update fixed it so now I'm happy :-)
00:32 < jotapesse> xor: good! :)
