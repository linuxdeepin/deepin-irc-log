00:02 < jotapesse> I also work daily with no problem. Obviously not as fast LMDE or Xfce, but fast enough, a bit faster than Unity, Gnome, KDE, I think, but I haven't exactly metered it.
00:02 < feenix> i know deepin not stable&fast as LMDE, but still is there any chance so that i can use deepin as main primary os
00:03 < jotapesse> it is my main OS
00:03 < jotapesse> no problem with 15.1.1
00:03 < jotapesse> Try a few days and see how it goes for you
00:04 < feenix> i saw some issues from users in deepin forum regarding vpn/proxy and etc., so im still thinking
00:04 < feenix> yeah okay sure :)
07:13 < makkon> Hi all!
07:18 < makkon> Derek Dai, thank you! Downloaded from the menu live mode Deepin15 and  Deepin15.1, next successfully installed! Live mode Deepin15.11- installed is fails after partitioning hdd.
07:19 < makkon> Thank you for your understanding and support.
07:25 < makkon> P.S. Remind, install Deepin  using ISO-image of the hard disk.
09:06 < makkon> Hi all! Derek Dai , can you tell me setting so that the installation took place in the mode without the GUI (no live mode)?
09:08 < makkon> Using ISO-image of the hard disk?
09:09 < makkon> Heartfelt thank!
10:41 < deepin-bot> [Derek Dai]:  Hi, makkon
10:44 < deepin-bot> [Derek Dai]:  It's doable without GUI, but you have to run some commands manually... no help from Deepin team currently
10:49 < deepin-bot> [Derek Dai]:  "installed is fails after partitioning hdd", my guest is that because of you are installing Deepin from your hard drive, you can do re-partition, but since a partition is mounted (the one that you load .iso from), kernel will refuse to update partition information, so...
12:35 < deepin-bot> [Derek Dai]:  Hi, makkon, I replied your post in forum to show you how to install Deepin without GUI
