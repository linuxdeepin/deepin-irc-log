15:31 < techknight_> Hi guys. I am missing a timezone in the clock for Copenhagen. is there anyw ay to manually install that?
15:33 < jotapesse> Hi. Check your time zone: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/denmark/copenhagen
15:33 < techknight_> I know what my time zone is but it doesn't appear in the list
15:33 < techknight_> in deepin
15:33 < jotapesse> Copenhagen is UTC/GMT+2
15:34 < jotapesse> it does in mine, naturally, search for UTC+2 not for "Copenhagen"
15:34 < techknight_> i have from +1 and then it springs to +3,5
15:34 < techknight_> A i foundt it
15:35 < techknight_> but it is one hiur in front of the time
15:36 < jotapesse> It should appear as UTC+2 Athens, Cairo, Istanbul
16:18 < techknight_> Found it ;) but it show the time is 11:17 but the time in denmark is 10.17
