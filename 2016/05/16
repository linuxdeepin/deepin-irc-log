22:47 < hualet> how's the telegram group ? jotapesse
22:47 < arunpyasi> hualet: cool. Means, something awesome is coming from Deepin ?
22:48 < hualet> arunpyasi: we've been working on the stability and performance for sometime
22:48 < hualet> hope it can be a great release
22:48 < jotapesse> hualet: it's ok, it got some traction recently, a few more members entered. I'll probaly upgrade it to a super-group these days
22:48 < arunpyasi> Thats cool hualet :)
22:48 < arunpyasi> And man, take care of your health too.
22:48 < hualet> jotapesse: cool
22:49 < hualet> arunpyasi: you too, man
22:49 < arunpyasi> hualet: have you seen s991533_ around in some 1 year ?
22:49 < arunpyasi> :P
22:49 < arunpyasi> hualet: yeah man, I also need to take care. I think I am running out.. :P lol
22:49 < hualet> nope, perhaps he's been busy too
22:49 < hualet> arunpyasi: haha
22:49 < hualet> arunpyasi: how's your busniness ?
22:50 < jotapesse> hualet: 15.2 release expected soon?
22:50 < arunpyasi> hualet: Ahh, is kinda well.. I am trying to build migratewizard.com for my new business.
22:50 < arunpyasi> hualet: I am like tired of freelancing :P
22:50 < hualet> jotapesse: yeah, it'll be available soon
22:51 < hualet> arunpyasi: cool
22:52 < arunpyasi> hualet: but I am confused what programming language to choose to build that platform :P lol
22:52 < jotapesse> hualet: nice! besides stability and performance enhancements, any new feature to be expected?
22:52 < hualet> arunpyasi: Python perhaps :P
22:53 < arunpyasi> hualet: haha, how you got my inner voice ? :P
22:53 < hualet> jotapesse: not much, new features are mostly cut by me :/
22:53 < hualet> arunpyasi: XD
22:53 < jotapesse> hualet: lol, you devil
22:54 < hualet> ;)
22:54 < hualet> see them in 15.3
22:55 < jotapesse> hualet: sure, I'm really more concerned with perfomance and stability
22:55 < hualet> jotapesse: me too, but others are more like new features :)
22:56 < jotapesse> hualet: in example, nautilius performance drives me crazy
22:56 < hualet> all GNOME stuff make me crazy
22:56 < jotapesse> hualet: YES, no we're talking!
22:56 < hualet> especially GTK and Nautilus
22:57 < jotapesse> I miss Thunar speed so much...
22:58 < jotapesse> And Xfce speed
22:58 < hualet> XD
22:58 < jotapesse> I wish deepin was based on Xfce :-)
22:58 < hualet> really ?
22:59 < hualet> I think that'll be terrible XD
22:59 < jotapesse> Debian + Xfce + DDE with GTK2 and 3 theme support... now that would be something
22:59 < jotapesse> why?
23:00 < hualet> they are not the same style
23:00 < hualet> what I really want is a very uniformed GTK theme
23:01 < jotapesse> Xfce is GTK and WM customizable you can make it look nearly the same
23:02 < jotapesse> uniformed?
23:02 < jotapesse> as in coherent right? me too!
23:03 < hualet> jotapesse: you got me, yeah, I want a theme to be coherent
23:03 < hualet> not something like the most themes on the web
23:05 < hualet> jotapesse: I haven't used Xfce much, it's not quite good looking by default XD
23:05 < hualet> jotapesse: It's late, I need to sleep now, see you :)
23:11 < jotapesse> hualet: ok, thanks. see you next time.
