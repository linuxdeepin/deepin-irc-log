01:31 < tuxhunter> steev
01:51 < tuxhunter> Hi can someone please answer me this how i change the kernel to the 4.6.2 and its runs fine my browser everyting except virtualbox and i know why but its affects something else in deepin
01:51 < tuxhunter> i change*
02:00 < tuxhunter> forget how
02:01 < tuxhunter> satu please help
02:01 < satu> what's the problem?
02:02 < tuxhunter> i want to know if chaning the kernel affects other stuff on the system
02:03 < satu> It shouldn't affect.
02:03 < tuxhunter> the only thing that affect is vbox
02:04 < satu> what kernel you are on?
02:05 < tuxhunter> 4.6.2
02:06 < satu> you can try this in terminal: sudo /sbin/rcvboxdrv setup
02:07 < tuxhunter> ok i will try it
02:08 < tuxhunter> command not found it shows me up
02:09 < satu> how about this?
02:09 < satu> sudo /ect/init.d/vboxdrv setup
02:13 < tuxhunter> command not found
02:15 < satu> ok. it's seems you are missing vbox kernel module. It's suppose to mantain your kernel updates.
02:15 < satu> Let's try to install it, if it's in the Depon repos...
02:16 < satu> Deepin...
02:16 < satu> sudo apt-get install dkms
02:16 < tuxhunter> ok install it again
02:17 < satu> That's one way to do it or just install that module.
02:17 < satu> sudo apt-get install dkms
02:17 < tuxhunter> its already installed
02:26 < tuxhunter> satu
02:26 < satu> ?
02:27 < tuxhunter> are you a dev of deepin?
02:27 < satu> No I'm not. Just user.
02:27 < tuxhunter> oh do you use fedora
02:28 < tuxhunter> because i am installing gnome-boxes is a type of vbox but of fedora
02:29 < satu> I had driver issues with original deepin so now I use Deepin on Manjaro. I haven't try gnome-boxes yet.
02:30 < tuxhunter> what is that driver issue
02:32 < satu> Wireless network. My wlan module is not well supported by linux, but now it works fine. Not good, but fine.
02:33 < tuxhunter> in linux deepin?
02:36 < satu> Yes and another debian based systems. Realtek RTL8723BE is my wireless card and it has broblems even in windows systems.
02:37 < tuxhunter> oooh 2 things or very old machine or broken wireless card
02:47 < satu> Yes.
02:48 < satu> I don't think it's network manager. It's same at KDE, Gnome etc.
02:48 < tuxhunter> ok which kernel version are you on?
02:50 < satu> 4.4. Tried newer ones, but this works best at least now.
02:51 < tuxhunter> ok 4.4 in manjaro
02:51 < satu> Yes.
02:52 < tuxhunter> try to install the same kernel version that install 4.6.2 and then boot the 4.6.2 kernel
02:52 < tuxhunter> that i*
02:53 < satu> I can try that.
02:53 < tuxhunter> yes you can try it
02:54 < tuxhunter> thats the beauty of linux you can install many kernels has you want but dont install to much kernels because it will slow a little bit your machine
02:55 < satu> Manjaro have great tool to manage kernels. So easy.
02:56 < tuxhunter> So install the 4.6.2 and reboot and boot the 4.6.2
02:56 < tuxhunter> if you know how to boot a different kernel
03:19 < satu> Yeah I know.
14:03 < sgjabjdsdgsdg> :-D
15:13 < user___> Hi
15:14 < steev> hiya
15:14 < user___> Is there a torrent file for deepin 15.2?
15:14 < steev> i'm not sure
15:15 < user___> ok , thanks.
16:10 < mechahop> is deepin based on KDE?
16:48 < MattD> No Deepin is based on Debian, and its desktop environment is developed from scratch
17:10 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  mechahop:   It's hard to say DDE based on which DE, they learn many things both from gnome and kde.   the GUI of DDE is developed mainly by qt5 currently ( before 2015, they use gtk mainly).   and the backend of DDE is mainly developed from scratch (before 2014, based on gnome).    Even in 2014, they use html5 to develop the desktop,dock,launcher ...
17:11 < mechahop> okay cool was little lost
17:24 < hualet_deepin> mechahop: It's not your fault, I was confused at first too :)
20:35 < brainy> hi allz
23:44 < brainy> I just wanted to say: opera browser is the best!
23:44 < brainy> Thanks for your attention.
