22:14 < MSPaint> Hello, I am attempting to install Deepin for the first time. However, my installer keeps issuing a Failed to Make error
22:14 < MSPaint> This is interesting, as I use this flash drive for all my installations
22:14 < MSPaint> I have redownloaded the ISO both from sourceforge and Mega
22:14 < MSPaint> https://paste.ee/p/DDAbl log file
22:15 < MSPaint> I am using Windows to try to write the 64bit iso to an 8gb fat32 flash drive
22:53 < MSPaint> Does not match the listed md5 https://blog.deepin.org/2016/06/announcementnow-you-can-install-latest-iso/
