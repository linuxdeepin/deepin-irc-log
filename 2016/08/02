22:50 < Bno> Hello all. I'm trying to get my optimus running xrandr offloaded graphics. Following the manual and using the deepin package provided nvidia driver I run into a segfault from libQt5Core
22:51 < Bno> Which keeps crashing lightdm-deepin
22:53 < Bno> How would I go about debugging and/or reporting this?
