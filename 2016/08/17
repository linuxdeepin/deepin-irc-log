20:43 < LuSky> hello
20:44 < LuSky> Maybe someone can help me. I was using Manjaro Deepin 16.06.1 without any problems til last update.
20:44 < LuSky> Since this update, the control center doesn't respond correctly and hangs. It's blank in some parts (network, backgrounds, icons...). I have no more hot corners even if I reactivete them. So, now Deepin is a pity !
20:45 < LuSky> Something strange : it runs ok in Virtualbox and on my laptop ! Is it a hardware or a driver problem ?
20:45 < LuSky> I can't find anything about this problem on internet !
20:46 < LuSky> Any ideas ? :)
20:48 < G-Ray> I don't use deepin/deepin-desktop
20:48 < G-Ray> But have you tried to delete the conf
20:48 < G-Ray> ?
20:49 < LuSky> Yes I did, but nothing changes
20:49 < G-Ray> nothing in the arch' wiki
20:49 < G-Ray> ?
20:50 < LuSky> Well no, I didn't find anything. It's like I was the only one who's gott this problem
20:50 < LuSky> I also tried Antergos and installed Deepin on it and same problems
20:51 < LuSky> Deepin is running on my latpop without problems since the last update but not on my desktop computer
20:51 < G-Ray> antergos and manjaro are all based on arch I think
20:51 < LuSky> Yes they are
20:52 < G-Ray> have you tried to downgrade the package ?
20:52 < G-Ray> by running pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/...
20:52 < LuSky> I didn't try to install Deepin on a Debian based distro
20:52 < LuSky> I didn't try that. What does it do ?
20:54 < Marqin> -U installs package from .xz package file
20:54 < G-Ray> yeah
20:54 < Marqin> in /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ you have archived package files
20:55 < G-Ray> exactly, so maybe by dowgrading the control center to the previous version, you can see if this is a bug
20:55 < LuSky> Well, how do you downgrade ?
20:57 < LuSky> I've never done that before
21:00 < G-Ray> pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/control-center-sthg-like-that :)
21:01 < G-Ray> .pkg.xz
21:01 < G-Ray> you have to find out what's the package name of the deepin control center
21:01 < G-Ray> or it may be the deepin package I don't know
21:01 < G-Ray> doing so could break dependencies :/
21:02 < LuSky> ok
21:03 < LuSky> I'll try that. I need to reinstall Deepin, so before updating, I'll uncheck all that concerns Deepin. It should be a good start.
21:04 < LuSky> But, do you have an idea why it runs on my laptop and not on my dektop computer ? I didn't change any hardware in it
21:04 < LuSky> Strange isn't it ?!
21:08 < LuSky> Thx for the informations
21:08 < LuSky> I'll give it a try
21:09 < G-Ray> it may be related to the graphic drivers
21:09 < G-Ray> idk :(
21:09 < LuSky> Maybe
21:10 < LuSky> I'll try to install without non-free drivers to test that possibility
21:11 < LuSky> I won't give up ! :)
21:14 < LuSky> Thx for all guys ! Maybe, I'll be back soon ! Bye
