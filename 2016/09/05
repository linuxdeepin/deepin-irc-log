19:53 < CountryfiedLinux> howdy
19:54 < CountryfiedLinux> Last time I used Deepin there was a bit of a delay between moving the pointer to the bottom edge and the dock popping up. Has this been fixed or at least have a way to speed it up?

20:56 < brainy> It's a very good question.
20:57 < brainy> But I don't think the bots here will answer. :(
20:58 < CountryfiedLinux> What about the people?
21:03 < brainy> They are half bot/half man :P
21:18 < brainy> hi hualet bro
21:19 < hualet> hi brainy :D
21:22 < brainy> CountryfiedLinux, I think hualet might be able to help you
21:23 < hualet> what's wrong ?

21:34 < CountryfiedLinux> hualet,
21:49 < hualet> CountryfiedLinux: Oh that's a way we figured out to prevent users from moving the pointer to the edge by accident and dock pops up
21:50 < hualet> how awkward :/
21:50 < CountryfiedLinux> I get that hualet but I prefer it to pop up immediately. I think there should be a feature to adjust the sensitivity.
21:50 < hualet> maybe we should make the delay configurable ?
21:51 < CountryfiedLinux> When I move my pointer to the panel I want it to pop up immediately. Yes hualet that would be great :)
21:51 < CountryfiedLinux> Gnome extensions have sensitivity settings too.
21:51 < hualet> CountryfiedLinux: OK that makes sense
