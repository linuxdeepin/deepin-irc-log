00:02 < felixonmars> yeah
00:02 < arunpyasi> I am facing issues with Deepin
00:02 < felixonmars> he left ~1.5h ago
00:03 < arunpyasi> No idea how but the EFI record of Deepin has been vanished from the boot menu
00:03 < felixonmars> but feel free to leave any comments here, as this channel is connected to a bearychat channel
00:03 < arunpyasi> and I am unable to boot
00:03 < felixonmars> so he'll be able to read even when he'
00:03 < felixonmars> s not here
00:03 < arunpyasi> felixonmars, yeah I have written
00:03 < felixonmars> :P
00:03 < felixonmars> good luck then, i have no experience with EFI
00:03 < arunpyasi> felixonmars, though, when he is available, do let him remind ok !! :D

00:10 < felixonmars> :P
08:40 < tmad> Hi. How can I change deepin-notifications settings like bubble size?
13:28 < hualet> tmad, you can
13:28 < hualet> sorry, you can't
13:29 < hualet> the notification bubbles are fixed size
13:31 < vodkode> hey hualet
13:31 < vodkode> how you been?
13:33 < hualet> vodkode, hey, I'm fine
13:34 < tmad> yea. found that out after looking at the source
13:34 < hualet> been very busy with some code stuff :)
13:34 < hualet> tmad, you can read the code, hummm
13:34 < tmad> yea
13:35 < tmad> you should consider pulling some of those numvers from a config file.
13:35 < tmad> would be awesome
13:37 < hualet> yeah, you're right, but it can just be fixed size if no one wants to change the size of it.
13:37 < hualet> :)
13:39 < tmad> also. you ignot notify-send -t arg
13:39 < tmad> ignore
13:40 < tmad> try it..  notify-send title message -t 15000
13:41 < tmad> the notification wont stay there for 15 seconds.
13:51 < hualet> deepin-notifications declares that it doesn't support the timeout capability...
13:52 < hualet> the OS designer designed it that way
13:52 < hualet> maybe notify-send ignores the capability check ?
14:03 < steev> maybe a patch to support it would be accepted? :D
14:11 < hualet> steev, that would be a huge patch I think
14:12 < steev> i meant supporting timeout, not necessarily the size
14:13 < steev> but, if someone wanted to put in the work and it wasn't detrimental, i can't see something like that being nacked
14:35 < hualet> yeah, that's tatally acceptable
