00:16 < jeff__> hello every body
01:14 < qkehan> I now use is deepin15
01:16 < qkehan> deepin store software is rarely
04:58 < __martin__> greetings
04:58 < __martin__> current release 15 seems to have compatibility issue in between proprietary blobbed gpu drivers and the xorg-xserver/kernel in use
04:59 < __martin__> has anyone resolved this any other way than using package provided through the vendor website? (=
04:59 < __martin__> thanks!
05:01  * __martin__ has one more thing on his mind regards preferred DNS servers and their overriding despite gui settings // might put into user feedback app

20:57 < brainy> hi fasheng
20:57 < brainy> Congratulations on Deepin 15
21:02 < deepin-bot> [fasheng]: thanks, brainy. i'm always happy to see you ;)
21:03 < brainy> happy to see you too xD
21:41 < brainy> welcome back hualet :D
21:41 < hualet> brainy: thanks man :D
22:49 < brainy> Firefox is so damn slow.
22:49 < brainy> Driving me nuts
22:56 < hualet> why don't you just switch to Chrome :P
22:57 < brainy> hualet, yeah, its a good option...but some useful addons I couldn't find for Chrome
22:57 < brainy> I'll have a try
22:58 < hualet> I personally use Chrome on deepin and Safari on Mac, though I respect Firefox much :D
23:03 < brainy> hualet, it's just an old habit to use Firefox xD
23:03 < brainy> But Opera is nice as well, as is Chrome
23:05 < brainy> hualet, I have a question and sorry for bothering you
23:06 < brainy> Deepin is now based on Debian I think? Does that mean that packages made for Ubuntu will not be compatible anymore?
23:07 < hualet> it depends, can you be more specific ?
23:08 < brainy> hmmm I mean in general, for example if I can't find a program in the Deepin Software Center and someone provided an external Ubuntu package for it, would I be able to install it without problems?
23:10 < hualet> As I said, it depends. I think most apps will be fine, except ones that rely on older libs or something
23:11 < hualet> don't worry man, brainy :D
23:12 < brainy> ok hualet thanks man xD
23:14 < hualet> brainy: you've installed deepin 15 on your machine ?
23:16 < brainy> hualet, I have tried it on VirtualBox first
23:16 < brainy> Now I want to backup my files and then I will install it
23:16 < brainy> It looks so beautiful xD
23:17 < hualet> beautiful as usual XD
23:17 < brainy> But I don't like the menu with such big icons, is it possible to make it like classic menu?
23:18 < brainy> Like on Ubuntu etc.
23:18 < hualet> you mean the Launcher ?
23:18 < brainy> yes
23:18 < hualet> what's the resolution of your machine ?
23:25 < brainy> I have full HD
23:25 < brainy> hualet,
23:26 < hualet> can you take a snapshot ?
23:27 < hualet> brainy ^^
23:32 < brainy> hualet, here bro:
23:32 < brainy> http://fs5.directupload.net/images/160105/2gg22dzi.png
23:34 < hualet> you're running that old version ? let me see... 12.12 ?
23:35 < hualet> I want to see how Launcher looks, bro XD
23:35 < hualet> brainy:
23:36 < brainy> hualet, it's Deepin 12.06 , but only the look ;)   It's actually Linux Mint 17.3 and I copied the old Deepin look because I love it so much
23:37 < brainy> Weird, I can't make a scrteenshot when the launcher is open
23:39 < brainy> ok here:
23:39 < brainy> http://www.directupload.net/index.php?mode=upload
23:39 < brainy> Sorry:

23:44 < brainy> (It's the Mate desktop)
23:46 < hualet> brainy: ah...I see, don't want to disappoint you, but we don't maintain that version for a long time
23:47 < brainy> hualet, it's Linux Mint with the theme of Deepin 12.06 ^^
23:47 < brainy> I just want a launcher like the one in the screenshot, is it possible??
23:48 < felixonmars> o/
