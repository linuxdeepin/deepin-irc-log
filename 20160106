12:50 < hualet_deepin> brainy: hi :D
12:51 < brainy> hualet_deepin, hi man xD
12:56 < hualet_deepin> fasheng: can you change the channel topic ? it's out date.
13:02 < brainy> hualet_deepin, some guy here made a suggestion which I think might be good, he suggested to have a 'Welcome Screen' in Deepin like the one in Linux Mint for example, so for example people could automatically join this server here if they have a question or just wanna chat
13:02 < brainy> What do you think about that?
13:05 < hualet_deepin> what is a "Welcome Screen" exactly, I don't get it, brainy ?
13:10 < brainy> hualet_deepin, http://fs5.directupload.net/images/160106/sy8m9wd5.jpg
13:10 < brainy> Something that shows up on the desktop after the first install
13:10 < brainy> You can see a direct link to the chat room on IRC
13:11 < brainy> And other things
13:11 < hualet_deepin> hmmm...sounds appealing to me, I'll let andy`` know :D
13:12 < brainy> ok ^^
13:12 < hualet_deepin> oh, andy`` is here
13:12 < brainy> thanks hualet_deepin
13:12 <@andy``> hello
13:13 < hualet_deepin> andy``: check this out  http://fs5.directupload.net/images/160106/sy8m9wd5.jpg
13:13 < hualet_deepin> brainy and his friends want that welcome screen thing :D
13:15 < brainy> Just a suggestion xD
13:22 <@andy``> hualet_deepin: Can you now set topic of IRC? I just give you channal admin.
13:26 < brainy> lol
13:26 < brainy> you guys keep disconnecting
13:27 < hualet_deepin> brainy: I'm trying to reset the channel topic here :)
13:28 < brainy> hualet_deepin, that's great :D
13:28 < brainy> You should also remove that typo "alreay released" xD
13:28 < brainy> It's been stuck there forever
13:29 < hualet_deepin> yeah, that's what I wanted to change long time ago, lol
13:29 < brainy> haha

22:36 < hualet> hi brainy
22:51 < felixonmars> hi brainy
22:52 < brainy> felixonmars, do you live far from hualet ?
22:55 < felixonmars> brainy: shouldn't be :P
22:59 < brainy> what does that mean felixonmars ? :)
22:59 < felixonmars> brainy: we are streets away i think
22:59 < brainy> Cool !
23:29 < zlatan999> hi to all
23:29 < zlatan999> is anyone here from deepin?
23:29 < zlatan999> or representative of the project in any way :)
23:32 < felixonmars> hualet: ^
23:32 < felixonmars> fasheng: ^
23:33 < hualet> zlatan999: I am, what's wrong :D
23:34 < zlatan999> hah, nothing wrong I think :)
23:34 < zlatan999> hualet: so I am sending the debian derivatives census to you guys
23:34 < zlatan999> sent one like ~10 days ago, now forwarded to other mail addresses
23:34 < zlatan999> so I was just thinking to maybe pop here directly
23:34 < zlatan999> and ask the current situation
23:36 < hualet> zlatan999: I don't know about it :D  where did you sent it ?
23:37 < zlatan999> first mail to support@, other two (hr@ and business@) just forwarded few mins ago
23:39 < hualet> hope they didn't treat it as spam
23:41 < zlatan999> me too, would be great to see deepin join census and port/package your stuff into Debian directly (that would be mutual benefit) :)
23:41 < zlatan999> also joing the derivatives talks on debconf would be good :)
23:42 < hualet> zlatan999: I can go talk to the people that manage those email addresses tomorrow (it's too late here)
23:42 < hualet> zlatan999: that would be great :D
23:42 < zlatan999> hualet: yes, please do! :)

23:52 < arunpyasi> you made cool wallpapers and effects on the surface? ;)
23:52 < hualet> arunpyasi: thank you for you concern :D
23:52 < arunpyasi> hualet: :D
23:53 < hualet> we rebuilt the DE totally in Qt
23:53 < arunpyasi> :D
23:54 < arunpyasi> bro, you guys use QML with QT right ?
23:54 < arunpyasi> or the design stuffs. :D
23:55 < hualet> arunpyasi: we wrote much QML, but we may not use that much QML in the future
23:55 < arunpyasi> hm.. ok bro.
23:56  * felixonmars whispers: and they used gtk2 inside their QML widgets
23:56  * felixonmars runs
23:56 < arunpyasi> QT with Python or C/C++ ?
23:57 < arunpyasi> hualet: ^
23:57 < hualet> felixonmars: where are you running :D
23:57 < hualet> Qt with C++
23:57  * felixonmars digs a hole and hide himself in
23:57 < hualet> arunpyasi: both Python and QML are slow
23:57 < hualet> felixonmars: that's good :P
23:58 < arunpyasi> hualet: bro, its not a question to ask to the team leader but I wanted to ask.. how fast is the speed improved than the previous 2014?
23:58  * felixonmars whispers again: and they used qt5-webkit inside their QML widgets
23:58 < arunpyasi> hualet: yeah bro, python and QML combination is more slow.
23:59 < hualet> arunpyasi: I don't know, but many people says its really faster, maybe you can try it someday :D
23:59 < brainy> arunpyasi bro , hope you feel better soon !!
