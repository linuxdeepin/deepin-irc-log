00:00 < arunpyasi> hualet: yeah bro, thats why I said, its not a question to ask to the team leader ;) yeah I'll try it tonight/tomorrow, I am downloading it. :D
00:00 < arunpyasi> brainy: thanks brother.
00:00 < arunpyasi> you tried the new release ?
00:01 < brainy> arunpyasi, I downloaded it 2 days ago, but too lazy to backup my files yet for install lool
00:01 < brainy> arunpyasi, your download is slow?
00:03 < hualet> arunpyasi brainy, too sleepy, and I'm gonna sleep, good night guys :D
00:04 < arunpyasi> brainy: yeah bro
00:04 < arunpyasi> I haven't run my VPS today so its slow.
00:04 < arunpyasi> brainy: its downloading in ~ 80 KB/s
00:04 < arunpyasi> if I had run my VPS, I would get ~ 2 MB/s ;) :D
00:06 < brainy> arunpyasi, I think it's their servers that are slow
00:06 < brainy> or did you find a good mirror?
00:06 < arunpyasi> brainy: no no, my speed is 80 KB/s :P
00:06 < arunpyasi> speed is fine.
00:06 < arunpyasi> its downloading from Taiwan and is good mirror for me.
00:07 < arunpyasi> brainy: here, internet is expensive.
00:07 < arunpyasi> brainy: whats your download speed international ?
00:11 < brainy> I have 16 mbit/s max
00:11 < brainy> But I remember that Taiwanese server was slow for me
00:12 < brainy> arunpyasi, 80kb/s is old-school
00:12 < brainy> :D
00:12 < brainy> I think it will be faster for hualet to send you the DVD from China xD
