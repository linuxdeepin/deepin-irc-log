09:40 < hualet_deepin> arunpyasi: hi brother :D
09:40 < hualet_deepin> good morning
09:40 < hualet_deepin> I heard someone need my help
09:44 < arunpyasi> hi bro
09:44 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: bro, Deepin 15 is cool :D
09:44 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: I tried it :D
09:44 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: but I got the control center hanging sometime..
09:44 < hualet_deepin> arunpyasi: good to hear it XD
09:45 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: bro, I noticed that you guys built deepin with Debian !!
09:45 < hualet_deepin> oh...it doesn't roll back or it just hangs ?
09:45 < arunpyasi> why you changed to debian bro ?
09:45 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: it roll backs
09:46 < arunpyasi> I liked the changes made :D
09:46 < hualet_deepin> because ubuntu changes its repository now and then which will leads us to death
09:46 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: it changed its repository ?
09:47 < hualet_deepin> when it bump from one major version to another, yes
09:47 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: bro, you guys rebuilt the debian repo completely ? I didn't see any external links to the debian repo.. I only saw the deepin repo :D
09:47 < hualet_deepin> and when its repository changes, ah...we've got a lot of things to do XD
09:48 < arunpyasi> yes I agree on that !!
09:48 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: now, chitwanix 1.5 has gone to death
09:48 < arunpyasi> :P
09:48 < hualet_deepin> XD
09:48 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: the defect of debian in nepal is that, we don't have a mirror in nepal for debian :(
09:49 < arunpyasi> we only have that of ubuntu so, people love ubuntu as the download is fast..
09:49 < arunpyasi> here, people use ubuntu or its derivatives more than other distros :P
09:49 < hualet_deepin> really ? that's bad
09:49 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: yeah man !!
09:50 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: I wanna open a server to store only the linux distros mirrors... how much will it cost for the complete setup of that ISP ?
09:50 < hualet_deepin> no one or organization wants to build a mirror for debian ?
09:50 < hualet_deepin> I don't know
09:50 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: an ISP wants to build but there are very less people to work..
09:51 < arunpyasi> hualet_deepin: and they are busy maintaining the system.
09:51 < hualet_deepin> in China, many colleges or companies own their mirrors
09:52 < arunpyasi> cool.
09:53 < arunpyasi> I wanted to own a server to mirror
09:53 < arunpyasi> but no idea what are the setup and cost needed.
09:53 < arunpyasi> I am wanting to open an ISP and host mirrors there.
09:54 < arunpyasi> so that all the Nepalese would feel comfortable with all the distros
10:32 < hualet_deepin> arunpyasi: great idea !
10:36 < arunpyasi> but I need cost required for the setup lol
10:36 < arunpyasi> I think I need contact some ISPs for the cost required.
10:37 < arunpyasi> whats the time there bro ?
12:09 < hualet_deepin> arunpyasi: sorry, I didn't notice your reply, it's 12:00am
