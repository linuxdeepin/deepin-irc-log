01:37 < LitoWushu_> hola alguien que hable español?
10:44 < ohms360> <brainy> hi ohms360
10:44 < ohms360> <brainy> That's an interesting nick name. xD
10:45 < ohms360> well I apparently missed the conversation
10:45 < ohms360> lol
11:03 < hualet> hi ohms360 :D
11:15 < ohms360> hi hualet
11:15 < ohms360> :)
11:15 < hualet> new friend, huh ? ohms360
11:16 < ohms360> pretty much yeah,
11:16 < ohms360> stumbled into this dist the other day
11:16 < hualet> then welcome to the deepin channel :D
11:16 < ohms360> thanks :-)
11:16 < hualet> so how do you think about it
11:17 < ohms360> bit of a debian nut so it all works well to my taste :D
11:17 < ohms360> it's the first distro that isn't slackware that I can sit down and enjoy using with emacs
11:17 < hualet> hmmm...you use emacs ?
11:18 < ohms360> yep
11:18 < ohms360> i also like marmite :P
11:18 < hualet> I used it for a little while the other year
11:19 < ohms360> back in 06 when i started using linux i struggled for a while with vim, never gelled with it
11:19 < hualet> and what's marmite ?
11:19 < ohms360> couple of months later tried emacs and i loved it
11:20 < ohms360> it's a sort of paste you can put on toast and stuff, the slogan is "you either love it or hate it" :DF
11:20 < hualet> yeah, I share the same experience with you :D
11:20 < ohms360> http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02321/marmite_2321702b.jpg
11:20 < hualet> I googled it and thought I got the wrong thing :D
11:21 < ohms360> hahaha
11:21 < hualet> you are from UK ?
11:21 < ohms360> yeah
11:21 < hualet> that's a good place :D
11:22 < ohms360> to an extent ;-)
11:23 < ohms360> but yeah, suitably impressed with deepin as a daily linux OS on my laptop
11:23 < ohms360> everything works, just mirror is slow so i'm in the process of making my own on one of my servers
11:23 < hualet> hmmm...please feel free to ping me here if you encounter some problems while using deepin :D
11:23 < ohms360> sure thing thanks :-)
11:24 < hualet> ohms360: you're going to build a mirror ?
11:24 < ohms360> yeah
11:24 < ohms360> see if that sorts out my slow repo gets
11:25 < ohms360> i'm impatient ;-)
11:25 < hualet> no mirrors of deepin repo in UK ?
11:25 < ohms360> there's the university of kent mirror service but that's still pretty dismal
11:26 < ohms360> where I am right now i can get about 200mbps down but still only get 800kb/s through that mirror
11:26 < hualet> yeah, pretty much users come to me complaining the bad download speed :(
11:27 < ohms360> the default repo was painfully slow for me, didn't bother seeing where it was located but I was getting about 32kb/s
11:27 < hualet> wow, what I see is that's good enough :p
11:27 < ohms360> lol
11:27 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  hualet: Mirror selected is not work in Deepin 15, we need fixed it in 15.1, many people in other country report this problem.
11:27 < ohms360> yeah
11:27 < ohms360> i'm just changing it manually in my apt sources for now
11:28 < hualet> yeah
11:28 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  ohms360: emacs guy, welcome ! ;)
11:28 < ohms360> greetings :D
11:28 < hualet> lol
11:29 < ohms360> my saying is if you can't use it comfortably in a coffee shop, you're using the wrong editor :P
11:29 < hualet> so you can use emacs comfortably in a coffee shop :P
11:30 < ohms360> yep :D
11:30 < hualet> but not vim lol
11:30 < ohms360> naw i can never get to grips with all of the key combos
11:30 < hualet> what do you use deepin/emacs for ? coding or writing ?
11:30 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  ohms360: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/andystewart my homepage, we have a lots words can talk. ;)
11:30 < ohms360> coding obj-c, c and java
11:31 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  ohms360: sorry, is this: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AndyStewart
11:31 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  ohms360: weclome to use deepin-emacs: sudo apt-get install deepin-emacs
11:31 < ohms360> *click*
11:31 < hualet> lazycat starts to show off his contributions to the emacs community :P
11:32 < ohms360> hey, always nice to see stuff getting added :D
11:32 < ohms360> i'll throw deepin on a wubi on my desktop and give it a go
11:32 < hualet> ohms360: ah...languages I don't use much :D
11:32 < ohms360> currently it's sat on my laptop for the past week and that's about it haha
11:33 < ohms360> hualet, i'm one of those that mainly do magic in swift on xcode nowadays but whenever i do java or whatever i always prefer emacs for it
11:33 < hualet> indie developer ?
11:33 < ohms360> pretty much yeah
11:33 < ohms360> just do it for my own gain and fun really
11:34 < hualet> that sounds cool, great man
11:34 < ohms360> anywho yes
11:34  * ohms360 downloads deepin again
11:35 < hualet> while I works on the web pages mostly nowadays :D
11:35 < ohms360> anybody who does professional web development has my absolute respect
11:36 < ohms360> i stopped freelancing as one just because of difficult people
11:36 < hualet> difficult people ?
11:37 < ohms360> yeah
11:37 < ohms360> the last time i did anything was a series of marketing emails for a design agency
11:38 < ohms360> and they did not have any clue on how to communicate colours in something designers would recognise: pantone or hex colours
11:38 < ohms360> took me hours to convince them to give me their initial sketches via email
11:39 < hualet> I can get you
11:39 < hualet> that's the most thing we developers hate
11:40 < ohms360> yeah
11:40 < ohms360> like i say anybody who can continue to cope with it has my absolute respect
11:41 < hualet> ohms360: hah, you get it wrong, when I say I works on the web pages I mean I mostly do schedules for my team :D
11:42 < hualet> it's my fault :P
11:42 < ohms360> oh haha either way still cool :-)
11:42 < ohms360> nice to get to know you guys here :-)
11:43 < hualet> ohms360: then how do you make a living as a indie developer ? I thought it was painful too
11:43 < hualet> nice to know you too :D
11:44 < ohms360> i took a path change a few months back instead of growing web design as a business and went to study at uni so I make my money through private reselling of webspace and photography/commercial videography
11:44 < ohms360> hence I have mirrorspace :P
11:45 < hualet> ohms360: hmmm...sounds less painful :P
11:45 < ohms360> a lot less! :D
11:46 < hualet> lol
11:47 < hualet> ohms360: I need to cook myself launch, see you later :D
11:47 < ohms360> take care man! :)
11:47 < hualet> you too :D
11:48 < ohms360> on that note i'm going to hit the hay and let my bnc lurk
11:49 < ohms360> oh and pardon any lack of responses to highlights, all of my things running hexchat are awful at notifying me, normally things are OK when I use textual
16:05 < lukas__> hey guys , i instaled deepin terminal in a arch distro but the terminal does not use my windows theme ..it keeps the deeping window theme ..anydoby know how i could make it use my own distro theme?
