02:09 < Silenthush> Hi there!
02:10 < Silenthush> I got deepin on my USB and want to do a Live session, however when the option screen pops up I only see Install deepin and Deeping failsafe, but no LiveCD option.
02:10 < Silenthush> Any idea? (Deeping 15)
02:27 < Nadlo> Is this distro rolling release and bleeding edge?
07:45 < Guest71243> anyone ?

20:25 < brainy> Have you tired it?
20:25 < brainy> tried*
20:25 < hualet> brainy: I've tried, why ?
20:28 < brainy> hualet, just interested in your opinion. It feels like Chrome browser, is it based on that?
20:30 < brainy> Just trying to find out what might be its advantages :)
20:30 < hualet> yes, I think
20:31 < hualet> brainy: it supports gestures like features :D
20:31 < hualet> that's all I know
20:32 < brainy> ok thanks hualet xD
20:34 < hualet> felixonmars: didn't you go to see the doctor ?
20:37 < felixonmars> no i didn't
20:37 < felixonmars> i have a broken server to fix
20:37 < hualet> brainy: do you use wechat or whatsapp ?
20:37 < hualet> felixonmars: haha
20:37 < felixonmars> and it's now delivering from beijing to wuhan...
20:38 < hualet> felixonmars: a server of what ?
20:40 < felixonmars> running our redmine and git server!
20:41 < brainy> hualet, I use whatsapp bro
20:41 < hualet> felixonmars: ah, I see
20:41 < brainy> I know wechat is very popular in China
20:42 < hualet> yeah, even some old people use it to communicate with their friends and chidren
20:51 < brainy> xD
20:52 < brainy> I find it funny when I see old people with a smartphone
20:52 < brainy> They must be like "telephones used to work differently when I was younger"
20:56 < brainy> hualet, do you use multiple chat clients on your phone?
20:58 < hualet> brainy: of course, I think most young people here in China have at least two IM clients installed on their phones
20:58 < hualet> QQ and wechat :D
20:58 < hualet> they both are built by Tencent
21:00 < brainy> nice man
21:01 < brainy> They spy for the Chinese government like whatsapp spies for the NSA? :)
21:01 < hualet> brainy: I don't know :D
21:03 < hualet> and to be frank, I don't care much, because I'm not that anti-government
21:04 < brainy> ok
21:04 < hualet> brainy: are you anti-government :P
