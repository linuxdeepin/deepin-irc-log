08:12 < bobo___> Hi all
08:30 < Giraffe_> hi
19:37 < hualet_deepin> hello, new friends. Giraffe_ gsareon and Karbowiak
19:37 < hualet_deepin> welcome :D
19:38 < Karbowiak> heya, thanks :)
19:52 < hualet_deepin> :D
20:48 < brainy> hualet_deepin, hi \o
20:48 < hualet_deepin> brainy: hi :D
20:49 < hualet_deepin> I'm writing code
20:49 < brainy> ok
22:24 < brainy> hi hualet man
22:34 < hualet> brainy: hi I'm home now
23:02 < zlatan> hey hualet
23:03 < hualet> hey zlatan :D
23:03 < hualet> how are you
23:03 < zlatan> question for all: are deeping images hybrid (so they can be installed on usb (via linux distro of course) with simple cp and sync?)
23:04 < zlatan> hualet, I am fine, thanks. How are you? :)
23:05 < hualet> zlatan: I'm fine too :D
23:06 < hualet> zlatan: you want to make a bootable USB ?
23:07 < zlatan> hualet, yea, I have this one laptop and I want to give it a spin but I only have Debian installed on everything :)
23:07 < zlatan> so I am just checking the type of images :)
23:07 < zlatan> Debian these days you just copy to usb and then use sync command to create bootable usb
23:08 < hualet> zlatan: I'm afraid you can't just dd the image to a USB and boot it up successfully
23:08 < zlatan> (copy the image to be precise)
23:09 < hualet> I've never tried that, I always use the Deepin Boot Maker to create the USB
23:09 < zlatan> hualet, is there and deb for deeping boot maker?
23:09 < zlatan> s/and/an
23:10 < brainy> doesn't unetbootin work?
23:10 < zlatan> brainy, unetbootin is unreliable as hell last few years so I don't even try that
23:11 < brainy> zlatan, well give it a try
23:11 < zlatan> brainy, did you try it?
23:12 < hualet> zlatan: http://packages.deepin.org/deepin/pool/main/d/deepin-boot-maker/ you can download it from there
23:12 < brainy> nice hualet
23:13 < hualet> zlatan brainy, some people tried unetbootin with deepin ISOs, some of them succeeded while some of them failed, I don't know why :D
23:13 < zlatan> hualet, okay, thank you :) now just to find quick mirror to download deepin :)
23:14 < brainy> hualet, for me the last version Deepin 2014.3 worked
23:14 < brainy> dont know about Deepin 15
23:14 < hualet> OK
23:14 < brainy> zlatan, good luck with that xD
23:15 < zlatan> brainy, haha :D
23:15 < zlatan> hualet, what is the problem with your mirrors anyway? even the 1.4MB deb is not gonna be downloaded like ever :)
23:16 < brainy> :(
23:17 < hualet> zlatan: no way, it works well here.
23:17 < brainy> hey zlatan , try this mirror:
23:17 < brainy> http://ftp.fau.de/deepin/pool/main/d/deepin-boot-maker/
23:18 < hualet> brainy: maybe you should suggest a mirror that near zlatan the most :/
23:18 < brainy> hmm sorry, if he is in Europe, it should be good
23:20 < zlatan> well I am in Germany currently :)
23:20 < brainy> There you go :-)
23:20 < zlatan> and I do live in Europe :)
23:20 < brainy> perfect mirror then, hualet ;)
23:20 < hualet> brainy: great :D
23:21 < hualet> maybe you two should hang out some day ;)
23:21 < brainy> :D
23:21 < zlatan> okay, the german mirror for iso is also quite fast
23:22 < brainy> nice
23:32 < hualet> alright, guys. Gotta go to sleep.
23:32 < hualet> see you brainy, zlatan feel free to leave messages here, I'll check tomorrow :
23:32 < hualet> D
23:33 < zlatan> hualet, g'night
23:33 < zlatan> brainy, did you already tried 15?
23:34 < brainy> only in a virtual box , zlatan bro
23:34 < brainy> I need to backup my files first, then I want to try it
23:34 < brainy> but im too lazy :P
23:43 < zlatan> hm installed the deeping boot manager but it doesn't start here
23:44 < zlatan> brainy, you did it with unetbootin?
23:46 < brainy> zlatan, I managed to make a bootable USB with the previous version of Deepin
23:46 < brainy> so can't say for sure about the current version if it will work
23:46 < zlatan> oh it starts (actually needs user pass and not root one) - it should probably contain some msg if it fails (or I am missing modules for it to display)
23:46 < brainy> ah, good!
23:47 < zlatan> boot manager looks nice, lets see if it works :)
23:56 < zlatan> yep, it works fine
