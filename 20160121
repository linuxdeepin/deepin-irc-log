00:06 < Giraffe_> thanks
00:06 < Giraffe_> Am curious, fedora partitioned one drive for me into  the /boot, /swap, etc
00:07 < Giraffe_> Does deepin? Or do I need to make four partitions?
00:07 < Giraffe_> (wonâ€™t stop me from installing, just dont want to make unnecessary partitions)
00:07 <@andy``> Giraffe_: No, Deepin installer just need one participation default
00:08 <@andy``> Giraffe_: We have two mode in deepin installer.
00:08 <@andy``> Giraffe_: Default one is "simple mode", you just need click any participation you want, then click "install" button, that's all.
00:08 < zlatan> andy``, yes, I have pretty much same vision
00:09 <@andy``> Giraffe_: If you're linux power user, you can click "advanced mode" to build your own partitions like other linux distributions.
00:09 < Giraffe_> awesome thanks
00:10 <@andy``> Giraffe_: Deepin installers is simplest linux installer, you can install it easier than windows even you don't have any linux knowledge.
