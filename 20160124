23:29 < bobo> Hulet, I got a problem about openconnect, the linux solution for Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN. Could you help me look at it?
23:30 < brainy> hualet, yeah we do that but mostly we talk about funny stories from the "old days" :D
23:31 < brainy> bobo where are you from, bro?
23:31 < bobo> China. I am now in U.S for studying.
23:32 < brainy> oh great
23:32 < hualet> brainy: ok
23:32 < bobo> Deepin is my working system.
23:32 < bobo> :D
23:32 < brainy> Thats great! Deepin connects the whole world
23:33 < brainy> from china to america to germany
23:33 < hualet> bobo: you can't setup a VPN connection?
23:33 < hualet> brainy: :D
23:34 < bobo> I cannot set it via the control center. There is no place to put my password.
23:34 < bobo> Hi bro. How do I post a screenshot here?
23:35 < hualet> bobo: you can use imgur.com
23:36 < hualet> brainy: what's the website you used to upload instant pictures ?
23:37 < bobo> http://imgur.com/bV5h87w
23:37 < bobo> Here's the screenshot of OpenConnect
23:39 < hualet> bobo: that's bad, I can't find a entry to put password, either
23:40 < hualet> :(
23:40 < brainy> hualet, I use directupload.net bro
23:40 < hualet> I'll report it to the developer
23:40 < brainy> hmmmm no password field
23:41 < hualet> brainy: ah...I just remembered
23:41 < brainy> xD
23:41 < hualet> yeah, I doubt why there's nobody even noticed
23:41 < hualet> bobo: you still there ?
23:42 < bobo> Fortunately, I can use Cisco's own app
23:42 < bobo> Yes. I am here
23:43 < hualet> bobo: I'll report the issue to our developer, sorry for the carelessness
23:43 < hualet> we'll fix it as soon as possible
