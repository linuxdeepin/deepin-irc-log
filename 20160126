22:47 < hualet> I thought Vivians was kicked out

22:48 < brainy> hi hualet felixonmars Vivians
22:48 < Vivians> hi hualet felixonmars brainy
22:48 < felixonmars> o/
22:48 < brainy> bobo, this bot is totally crazy xD
22:48 < hualet> that bot drives me crazy
22:49 < hualet> felixonmars: ah...one question for you, how did the bot in archlinux-cn works, how did it grab the major information from one url ?
22:50 < felixonmars> hualet: it writes rule for certain sites, and use a general extractor for anything else
22:51 < hualet> felixonmars: ok, I see
22:51 < hualet> thx
22:51 < felixonmars> normally it uses only the <title> fields
22:52 < hualet> that sucks :P
22:52 < hualet> I thought there's some general rules can apply to everything :D
22:53 < hualet> I mean any url
22:55 < brainy> Guys what's the difference between Chromium browser and Chrome browser?
22:59 < brainy> hi clima
22:59 < clima> hi
23:14 < hualet> brainy: the flash player ? :P
23:24 < brainy> ok thanks hualet
23:26 < hualet> brainy: also Chromium is open sourced while Chrome is not, Chrome seems to be better maintained by Google :D
23:28 < brainy> hualet, I cant find Chrome in the software manager of Mint
23:29 < brainy> Need I download it separately?
23:29 < brainy> Anyway , see you later hualet bro
23:29 < felixonmars> yep. its license prevents redistribution.
23:30 < felixonmars> :/ i'm too late
23:30 < hualet> it seems that deepin violated that license ?
23:31 < hualet> felixonmars: ^^^
23:32 < felixonmars> yep
23:32 < felixonmars> deepin may violate qq's license too
23:33 < hualet> will Google and Tencent crush us like a bug ? :'(
23:35 < felixonmars> hualet: community-driven distributions often take this very carefully. also companies in N.American/Europe will have to be careful
23:36 < felixonmars> hualet: if deepin is going to do business in these regions, it would be a serious problem
23:37 < hualet> felixonmars: OK, thanks for the information
23:38 < hualet> it'll be long enough, maybe we can make a deal with Google and Tencent :P
23:38 < felixonmars> the first EULA i got from kingsoft excludes N.American from redistribution, as they have something with microsoft
23:38 < felixonmars> that's also a way to avoid legal problems - just don't distribute to those regions
23:39 < felixonmars> but IANAL, so :P
23:40 < hualet> felixonmars: but you hire lawyers :P
23:40 < felixonmars> i can ask for legal advices from SPI though, but that's only for SPI member projects.
23:42 < hualet> :D
