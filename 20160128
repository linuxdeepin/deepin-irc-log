00:18 < Vivians> felixonmars, ↑ Image/png, size = 838x457 pixels
00:19 < felixonmars> so i have to delay the new dde-daemon release until i find a workaround
09:20 < deepin-bot> [fasheng]: felixonmars: really bad news...
10:19 < makkon>  Hi! Deepin 15 Well, this really is a bright star on the linux horizon. However, a small problem, Deepin does not fit for everyone except the British and the cultures that use the characters. Please note that most of the peoples use when typing native language together with Latin letters.
10:20 < makkon> This requires constant switching of the keyboard layout, for example: EN/DE, EN/RU, EN/RU/KZ, EN/CH. Moreover, some countries officially use multiple languages, and thus can use more than two layouts! Also for the user it is important to see what kind of layout is currently enabled. For this purpose the screen should be a keyboard layout indicator! For example: EN/RU. In the community there are solutions to this problem. But this is 
10:22 < makkon> But It seems like that switching between keyboard layouts is so slow. it will take 4 second of time. Is there any temporary solution to switch between keyboard layouts faster?﻿
10:23 < sbw> yes, you can choose multiple keyboard layouts and toggle them by <Spuer + Space> shortcut key
10:24 < makkon> it will take 3 second of time.
10:26 < sbw> oh, we add a short delay before apply your change
10:31 < makkon> Excuse me how to set 1 sec?
10:33 < sbw> maybe you can report a suggest in http://bugzilla.deepin.io

10:55 < hualet_deepin> makkon: still there?
10:56 < hualet_deepin> we've fixed the problem, you'll see it takes effect immediately after you switch the keyboard layout with Super+Space
10:57 < hualet_deepin> makkon: I mean after the update that will be released this weekend
10:59 < makkon> Super+
11:12 < makkon> hualet_deepin, Question 2. The keyboard layout only Rassian-legacy so the symbol is wrong type.
11:15 < hualet_deepin> makkon: I'm not sure, but I see plenty keyboard layouts for Russian, have you tried other ones ?
11:16 < makkon> 105 key win?
11:19 < makkon> dos, phonetic so the symbol is wrong type.
