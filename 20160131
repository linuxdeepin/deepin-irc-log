02:29 < arunpyasi> I am happy in my place.. will/may go for vacation in ktm.
02:29 < arunpyasi> KTM is not a safe and good place to live.
02:29 < arunpyasi> is very very crowdy, polluted place.
02:30 < brainy> ohh I didn't know arunpyasi
02:30 < arunpyasi> I don't like that environment. I love peace and good environment. :D
02:30 < brainy> people are bad in KTM?
02:30 < arunpyasi> here, in my city is good. I like this place.
02:30 < arunpyasi> brainy: no
02:30 < arunpyasi> brainy: people are good but the place is crowdy and unsafe from earthquake
02:31 < arunpyasi> the land is of clay
02:31 < arunpyasi> is very very fertile land.
02:32 < brainy> I understand arunpyasi bro
02:32 < brainy> I dont like crowded places too
02:34 < arunpyasi> ahh :D
02:34 < arunpyasi> brainy: how is your place ?
02:34 < arunpyasi> brainy: I lived around 7 years in KTM.. My childhood was spent in ktm. :D
02:57 < brainy> wow nice man
02:57 < brainy> arunpyasi, I live in crowded place, in capital of Germany (Berlin)
02:58 < brainy> But its not as crowded as many other cities in the world ( we have 3.5 million people)
02:58 < brainy> so it's ok :)
02:59 < arunpyasi> cool bro :D
03:00 < brainy> arunpyasi, do you have problems with Muslims in Nepal?
03:07 < arunpyasi> brainy: no bro we don't have.

03:08 < arunpyasi> brainy: is there anything like in US there?
03:08 < brainy> what do you mean bro?
03:09 < arunpyasi> brainy: I mean, like in US, some american people don't like Muslims... blah blah..
03:09 < arunpyasi> we Nepalese live together equally though we are of different religion, castes, tribes, etc.. :D
03:09 < brainy> arunpyasi, thats great man
03:10 < brainy> yes, bro,  many people here dont like muslims
03:10 < arunpyasi> oh :(
03:10 < brainy> like in US
03:12 < arunpyasi> brainy: bro, what I think is there is nothing good or bad with religion.. all religion are equal and teaches the same thing.. but people here are using religion to perform bad activities..
03:12 < arunpyasi> I respect all the religions.
03:12 < brainy> I understand you and agree arunpyasi bro
03:13 < brainy> thanks for giving me this information, it's so nice to learn about the world :)
03:13 < brainy> arunpyasi, what I like about Linux community is that generally they are very open to all people
03:13 < brainy> it doesnt matter your religion/color of skin etc.
03:14 < arunpyasi> as they have their own importance and practices.. those terrorists are using religion for criminal activities.. making Muslim religion as terrorists to the people... BTW, Quran has very good things on it.
03:14 < brainy> right
03:14 < arunpyasi> brainy: yeah bro thats why I like Linux Community too :D
03:14 < arunpyasi> brainy: we all people have almost same thoughts and things to do :D
03:14 < brainy> arunpyasi, exactly man
03:15 < arunpyasi> brainy: and this platform has made world really the smallest place. We learn, share, meet people whom we have met yet. :D hehe

03:25 < arunpyasi> talip: but works when headphone is plugged ?
03:26 < talip> yes
03:27 < arunpyasi> talip: then, its not your sound driver problem. you don't need to reset it.
03:27 < arunpyasi> talip: there must be some configuration problem or your speaker's problem.
03:28 < talip> hm i think its configuration problem
03:28 < talip> and when i put headphone and put back when i repeat this
03:29 < talip> its stop the working
03:30 < arunpyasi> talip: did u try rebooting your PC ?
03:30 < talip> yes
03:31 < arunpyasi> ok try running this in your terminal.
03:31 < arunpyasi> amixer sset 'Master' 50%
03:31 < arunpyasi> amixer -q sset Master toggle
03:32 < talip> hm i do
03:32 < arunpyasi> did that fix ?
03:33 < talip> no
03:33 < arunpyasi> try playing a music and see if the volume is set to mute or not.
03:33 < talip> i'm getting error on sudo apt-get update
03:33 < arunpyasi> you don't need to enter sudo apt-get update for fixing this.
03:33 < talip> N: Ignoring file 'spotify.listecho' in directory '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/' as it has an invalid filename extension
03:34 < arunpyasi> can you send the error while running the above command via dpaste.com ?
03:34 < arunpyasi> run this to fix:
03:34 < talip> okay
03:34 < arunpyasi> sudo rm -rf /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.listecho
03:35 < talip> http://dpaste.com/2H3FVW7
03:39 < arunpyasi> what you see when running amixer -q sset Master toggle ?
03:41 < talip> there is nothing
03:41 < arunpyasi> talip: ok. cool. Now your volume must have been muted in the control center.
03:41 < arunpyasi> please have a look.
03:42 < talip> no :)
03:42 < talip> its not mured
03:42 < talip> muted*
03:42 < arunpyasi> talip: ok .
03:42 < arunpyasi> next try another method.
03:42 < arunpyasi> run the following
03:42 < arunpyasi> sudo alsa force-reload
03:42 < talip> okay
03:43 < talip> sudo: alsa: command not found
03:43 < arunpyasi> ok then run this
03:43 < arunpyasi> sudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base pulseaudio
03:44 < arunpyasi> then this : sudo apt-get install alsa-base pulseaudio
03:44 < arunpyasi> then : sudo alsa force-reload
03:44 < talip> okay
03:45 < arunpyasi> brainy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dbEhBKGOtY you have listened this song ?
03:46 < talip> still alsa command not found
03:47 < arunpyasi> now run this : sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
03:47 < arunpyasi> then try again
03:48 < talip> alsa-utils is already the newest version (1.0.29-1+b1).
03:48 < arunpyasi> lol
03:48 < talip> The following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:
03:48 < talip>   libpulse-mainloop-glib0
03:48 < talip> Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove it.
03:48 < arunpyasi> no don't do that.
03:48 < talip> okay
03:50 < arunpyasi> talip: sudo apt-get install --reinstall alsa
03:50 < talip> Package alsa is not available, but is referred to by another package.
03:50 < talip> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
03:50 < talip> is only available from another source
03:50 < talip> E: Package 'alsa' has no installation candidate
03:51 < arunpyasi> talip: sudo apt-get install --reinstall alsa-utils
03:51 < talip> okay i did but still
03:51 < talip> alsa command not found
03:52 < arunpyasi> talip: thats weird
03:52 < talip> yes my sound was not working on ubuntu
03:52 < talip> but its working on Linux Mint and Deepin
03:53 < talip> my sound driver its weird i think
03:53 < talip> my sound chip
03:58 < brainy> arunpyasi, you tried to help him, it was very nice man
03:58 < talip> yes thank you so much
03:58 < arunpyasi> NP. I like helping people in need.
03:59 < brainy> :D
03:59 < arunpyasi> talip: lets go for next step if that alsa didn't work.
03:59 < arunpyasi> sudo gedit /etc/default/speech-dispatcher
03:59 < arunpyasi>  change RUN=yes to RUN=no
04:00 < talip> its empty
04:00 < arunpyasi> hehe
04:00 < arunpyasi> lol
04:00 < talip> :)
04:00 < arunpyasi> ok then, do this: alsamixer
04:01 < talip> i did
04:01 < talip> there is alsa mixer v1.0.29
04:01 < arunpyasi> talip: ok can you see your speaker ?
04:01 < talip> yes
04:01 < arunpyasi> make that volume full
04:02 < arunpyasi> and make sure its not muted.
04:03 < talip> i did its not muted i think
04:03 < talip> may i need dpkg-reconfigure alsa-base
04:03 < talip> but dpkg-re.. not found
04:04 < arunpyasi> haa !! may be deepin doesn't have dpkg-reconfigure.
04:04 < arunpyasi> talip: its weird. ubuntu has dpkg-reconfigure.
04:04 < arunpyasi> talip: is your PC a laptop ?
04:04 < talip> laptop
04:05 < talip> how can i install it
04:05 < brainy> arunpyasi, new deepin is based on debian, does it make a difference?
04:05 < arunpyasi> sudo apt-get install debconf
04:06 < talip> debconf is already the newest version (1.5.58).
04:07 < arunpyasi> brainy: yeah bro. it makes a huge difference. Previous deepin used to use the packages and repo of ubuntu whereas now of debian.. Some packages differs but not the system.. Ubuntu supports Debian but debian may not completely support ubuntu packages.
04:07 < arunpyasi> talip: what you see when running sudo apt-get install dpkg-reconfigure
04:08 < talip> E: Unable to locate package dpkg-reconfigure
04:09 < arunpyasi> talip: whats your laptop model and company ?
