08:28 < bobo__> Hi. My Desktop doesn't show any files or folders. I can still access them via file manage, but they don't show up in the desktop.
08:37 < bobo__> help @fasheng
09:07 < bobo__> Good morning, hualet_deepin sbw
09:07 < hualet_deepin> morning bobo__
09:07 < sbw> morning :P
09:17 < bobo__> I have a problem.  My Desktop doesn't show any files or folders. I can still access them via file manage, but they don't show up in the desktop
09:17 < bobo__> hualet_deepin, could you give me a temp solution? I have already reported the bug.
09:19 < sbw> maybe is your dde-desktop crashed
09:19 < sbw> you can try to execute dde-desktop in terminal
09:20 < bobo__> dde-desktop is running!
09:20 < bobo__> That's output
09:20 < sbw> oh ;(
09:20 < hualet_deepin> bobo__: you can kill dde-desktop after you logged in
09:21 < hualet_deepin> our DE will bring it up later
09:21 < bobo__> It works
09:21 < bobo__> Great
09:21 < bobo__> kill dde-desktop
09:22 < bobo__> Thank you hualet_deepin sbw
09:22 < bobo__> Hi brainy
09:23 < hualet_deepin> bobo__: nah, sorry for the trouble
09:23 < brainy> hi bobo__ bro
09:23 < brainy> hi hualet_deepin man
09:23 < bobo__> It's fine. Deepin is becoming better and better.
09:29 < brainy> bobo__, have yound some bugs in Deepin?
09:29 < brainy> "have you found"
09:30 < hualet_deepin> brainy: some users reported that their dock became useless after they upgrade to 15.1 :(
09:31 < brainy> oops..
09:31 < bobo__> I just encounter one. hualet_deepin and sbw help me to solve it.
10:48 < zhenxi> 我想问下，怎么用debootstrap装deepin 15呢
10:49 < sbw> 没有用过
10:50 < zhenxi> deepin 15的代号是什么啊
10:50 < zhenxi> 发行版本代号
10:51 < bobo__> 15.1? 猜的， 好像没名字
10:52 < sbw> 好像真的没起名字23333
10:52 < sbw> 是应该起个名字的
15:50 < gromith> anyone here?
15:50 < gromith> I'm running DDE on arch and my panel has disapeared :p
15:52 < sbw> panel?  control panel? or dock?
15:55 < gromith> The thing in the bottom of my screen
15:55 < gromith> I guess that's a dock
15:55 < gromith> I say "the thing in the bottom of my screen"
15:55 < gromith> but it's not in the bottom of my screen right now
15:55 < sbw> yes, its dock, you can execute pkill dde-dock in your terminal
15:56 < gromith> ah thanks
15:56 < gromith> that worked
15:56 < sbw> and dde-dock should be auto restart and move to correct pos
15:56 < gromith> doesn't auto-restart tbh
15:56 < gromith> ah nvm it does
15:56 < gromith> just takes a while
15:57 < gromith> I was being impatient and starting it manually
15:57 < gromith> cool, now I can do stuff :)
15:57 < sbw> okay ╮(╯_╰)╭
16:19 < gromith> btw, dunno if there are any devs here, but great work on deepin :)
16:19 < gromith> and thanks for the help sbw

23:21 < aimujie> brainy that's true
23:22 < hualet> that's bad then
23:22 < aimujie> and it is the drivers that matters

23:30 < felixonmars> hi :3
23:30 < hualet> you two knew each other ?
23:31 < aimujie> felix's a famous arch maintainer, right?
23:31 < felixonmars> arch maintainer is true, but not famous :P
23:33 < hualet> felixonmars: don't be too humble, you're famous :P
23:34 < felixonmars> ><
23:39 < brainy> meow felixonmars
23:39 < felixonmars> meow brainy :3
23:40 < hualet> I just learnt that felix is sort of equal to cat a few days ago
23:40 < brainy> Xd
23:41 < hualet> so your name should be pronounced like felix-on-mars ? felixonmars :P
23:42 < felixonmars> hualet: correct!
23:42 < hualet> :D
23:44 < hualet> I read it on Quora about an ancient animal called felix-somehing that can crunch human's skull
23:44 < felixonmars> you should read something warmer in the cold winter
23:45 < felixonmars> like www.felixthecat.com
23:45 < hualet> like what ?
23:45 < hualet> :/
23:46 < hualet> looks very adorable, just your type :P
23:47 < felixonmars> xD
23:49 < brainy> haha
23:50 < hualet> brainy: what's your suggestion ?
23:51 < brainy> hualet, for what? :D
23:52 < hualet> for something worth reading in this cold winter :P
23:52 < brainy> hmmmm
23:52 < brainy> I don't really read novels hualet bro
23:53 < hualet> actually I'm reading a book about go programming language, but all I've read is about the history of Unix XD
23:53 < brainy> But I liked to read Stephen King when I was younger
23:53 < brainy> Do you know him?
23:53 < hualet> I don't, let me search about him
23:53 < brainy> hualet, you wanna learn all possible programming langauges? xD
23:53 < brainy> your head will explode man
23:54 < brainy> Stephen King writes horror books
23:54 < hualet> brainy: nope, our team needs me to learn go.
23:54 < brainy> oh ok
23:55 < hualet> brainy: oh my god, forget about it then
23:55 < brainy> lool
23:55 < hualet> I don't like horror fictions
23:55 < aimujie> How to go (lol)
23:57 < hualet> actually I'm too timid to read horror fictions XD
23:57 < hualet> and horror movies...
23:58 < brainy> no problem hualet
23:58 < brainy> You can read "Just for fun" by Linus Torvalds
23:58 < brainy> Another "classic"
23:58 < hualet> brainy: actually I've read it already
23:59 < brainy> I thought so :P
23:59 < aimujie> Have you read The Inevitable, hualet?
