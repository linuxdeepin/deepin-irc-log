00:07 < Velociround> hi everyone! I'm new here, and I want to start by saying Deepin is awesome!
00:08 < Velociround> I'm running into a few problems, though; I can't figure out how to configure proxy server correctly. I was using Ubuntu before and everything worked with the proxy server, but in Deepin some apps are not working with proxy at all
00:09 < Velociround> I configured apt-get apt.conf and now I have apt-get working with proxy. I also configured wgetrc to use the proxy. I also configured system-wide (Control Center) proxy settings and applied it
00:10 < Velociround> but the system-wide proxy settings do not seem to work. Deepin Store can not connect to the internet. Chrome and Firefox can not connect to the internet.
00:11 < Velociround> I managed to connect to the internet by overriding the proxy settings in Firefox settings. Firefox works now. But system-side (Control Center) proxy settings do not appear like they are working
00:11 < Velociround> I tried searching Google all day but I can not find anything on the internet to fix this
00:12 < Velociround> I am using Deepin 15.1 (based on Debian unstable)
00:16 < Velociround> I tried in terminal to "echo $http_proxy" and it shows my proxy correct
00:19 < Velociround_> I tried in terminal to "echo $http_proxy" and it shows my proxy correct, but the Deepin Store does not work
00:59 < bobo> hi Velociround_
01:00 < bobo> As I know, there is a bug for the proxy in deepin.
01:01 < Velociround_> hi bobo! what do you mean by bug? Is there a workaround?
01:01 < bobo> https://github.com/fasheng/arch-deepin/issues/241
01:01 < bobo> It's a bug report in arch. I guess it's the same for original deepin.
01:02 < Velociround_> I see... what's the difference between Deepin (original) and Deepin Arch, by the way?
01:03 < Velociround_> I'm using Deepin at work and nothing works without a proxy here
01:04 < bobo> You may try to ask deepin guys in the daytime( + 8 time zone). They are sleeping now.
01:04 < bobo> Sorry for that
01:04 < bobo> They may have a temp solution.
01:05 < bobo> To my opion, the difference between manjaro deepin and original deepin is the software management.
01:06 < bobo> In origianl deepin, there is deepin software store. In manjaro, they use aur and pacman.
01:08 < Velociround_> Thank you. I'm trying to find a temp solution or workaround. I used Deepin at home and I loved, everything worked just fine, so I installed it at work but when I tried to set up proxy it didn't work
01:09 < Velociround_> I work at infrastructure and we use the proxy for everything (this way we can monitor every user and their history on the internet). It's not up to me, though, so I can't simply decide not to use the proxy server; all connections are refused/denied without a proxy
01:10 < Velociround_> When I setup proxy in apt.conf I managed to download Firefox and override the system proxy settings in Firefox, so I could at least search for a solution on the internet
01:12 < Velociround_> Thank you again, I'll keep searching for a solution, and I'll try to talk to the Deepin guys when they are awake. I'm at -3 time zone
01:14 < bobo> https://github.com/linuxdeepin/lastore-daemon/blob/master/deepin_repository.org
01:14 < bobo> This is about the repository in deepin.
01:14 < bobo> I cannot find the English version. It's chinese.
02:46 < Velociround_> I translated it using Google Translate but couldn't see how I could use it to setup the proxy. It seems to explain how the Deepin Store communicates with the server to update software
04:36 < mdfkr> hello
05:03 < mdfkr> anyone here can support me?
05:59 < Kezzly> Does anybody know if this version supports Mobile Broadband connection? Deepin 14 doesn't.
