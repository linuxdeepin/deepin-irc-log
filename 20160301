08:00 < linuxnoobie> Hi, is anyone here?
08:54 < linuxnoobie> Anyone?
09:02 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]: hi, linuxnoobie: ;)
09:03 < linuxnoobie> Hi, I have a problem
09:04 < linuxnoobie> I just bought a new laptop which came with Windows 10 installed. I installed Deepin on the empty space, but I can't seem to boot in it.
09:04 < linuxnoobie> I also can't see the menu where I can choose between the two operating systems.
09:06 < linuxnoobie> Do you have any ideas as to what may be the problem?
09:07 < deepin-bot> [Choldrim]: how many disk you use, just one?
09:08 < linuxnoobie> Yes, just one.
09:09 < linuxnoobie> I don't know if it's relevant, but UEFI is enabled.
09:09 < linuxnoobie> I have never had a system which uses UEFI, so I am not familiar with it.
