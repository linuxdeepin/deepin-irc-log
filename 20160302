05:39 < qih> Hi all.
05:55 < qih> Re https://www.deepin.org/download.html, the Flash video does not work coming from an NZ IP address. Bug or my crap connection?
05:56 < qih> Also as a suggestion, please make a HTML5 video and get rid of that Flash rubbish 8-)
06:06 < qih> Is there a .Torrent available for the 64-bit Deepin .iso?
08:15 < qih> Found a .Torrent, 2GB file though, wow.
10:27 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  qih: what is the  meaning of NZ IP address
10:39 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:   New Zealand ?
10:40 < deepin-bot> [snyh]:  qih:  Is there has a way we can test this online from China ?

23:12 < Niubility> well, seems that there is no chinese input support.
23:12 < Niubility> anyone online?
23:13 < felixonmars> there is
23:13 < felixonmars> but only good guys can find it xD
23:13 < Niubility> well, this is my first time using irc
23:16 < Niubility> is it because hexchat is not very compatible with os x?
23:23 < Niubility> IRSSI then.
23:25 < brainy> There is no Chinese keyboard? But how do you guys chat in Chinese here then?
23:40 < Niubility> 呵呵
23:40 < Niubility> better support
23:40 < Niubility> why is there so few people?
23:40 < brainy> welcome back Niubility
23:40 < Niubility> thanks
23:41 < brainy> Deepin need to put a short-cut to this channel on their desktop by default
23:41 < brainy> in my opinion
23:41 < brainy> then we will have more people here
23:41 < Niubility> true that
23:42 < Niubility> i found installing irssi abit troublesome on mac
23:42 < Niubility> so i am using colloquy
23:44 < brainy> as long as it's free it should be good xD
23:44 < Niubility> yeah
