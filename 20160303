01:10 < tulipm> hi
01:11 < tulipm> Where is the sourcecode for the part relevant for virtual desktops?
01:11 < tulipm> I'm curious how much work it requires to add multiple wallpaper support :)
01:11 < tulipm> or if there is already a PR available somewhere
01:14 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  tulipm: We will add multiple wallpaper in next version, that every virtual desktop has it's own wallpaper
01:15 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  tulipm: We have this mission one year ago, just not enough time implement in Deepin 15
01:16 < tulipm> oh that's awesome!
01:16 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  tulipm: And we will open the setting of login/lock background in next version.
01:17 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  tulipm: Thanks for your suggestion anyway! ;)
01:17 < tulipm> Magnificent!
01:19 < tulipm> As far as I've seen, there are many python based applications. I've not profiled it yet, but appears like that dde-session-daemon has some memory regressions. Or it's implementation requires unusual amounts of ram on a fresh install
01:22 < felixonmars> dde-session-daemon was written in Go though :P
01:23 < tulipm> Indeed, I've just noticed that. Which is a good choice, afaik go's toolset has good profiling support.
01:34 < arunpyasi> hi everyone
01:34 < tulipm> hmm checking https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-daemon/blob/master/bin/dde-session-daemon/daemon.go I can't see an obvious problem. Using mutex to pass data and for locking is not the fastest method, but it's quite common and the impl. looks streightforward.
01:38 < deepin-bot> [manateelazycat]:  tulipm: Welcome to join us, happy hacking! ;)
01:41 < tulipm> Thank you :)
