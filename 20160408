22:05 < satu> Is there more Deepin spisific apps that music, movie, terminal and screenshot what comes with Manjaro?
22:05 < satu> File manager, Nautilus?
22:06 < dance707> yes
22:07 < satu> Ok, thanks. Have to think about it... Deepin Software Center looks nice, but AUR is great too. :)
22:07 < brainy> :D
22:07 < brainy> Will you try Deepin, satu?
22:09 < satu> I think so. Manjaro Deepin works nice on my laptop too, but original is always original.
22:09 < dance707> satu GParted, Deepin User Feedback , System montitor
22:09 < dance707> satu yes I much prefer the Debian base, but DDE on Manjaro works good too :)
22:10 < satu> I'm little skeptic to Debian as I used Ubuntu for long. They have really old software... :D
22:12 < dance707> satu its based on Debian(sid)
22:12 < satu> Yes I know. Before it based on Ubuntu am I right?
22:13 < dance707> satu You can always check it out in a VB, but they do recommend a real environment :)
22:14 < dance707> satu yes previous version was Ubuntu based, I am glad they are based on Debian now :)
22:15 < satu> Yeah. I'm writing it on usb as we speak. I'm coming back if something goes wrong. :D
22:15 < dance707> satu Good Luck, rest time for me :)
