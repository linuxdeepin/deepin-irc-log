01:38 < ohms360> hmmmm
01:38 < ohms360> I have the want to compile deepin's DE for powerPC and install on Deb PPC
03:28 < Sterver> Hell'o all.... Simple question, where can I find any nice text/article about Deepin Desktop Environment?
07:43 < steev> ohms360: i feel ya, i want to do the same, but for arm64
08:09 < steev> sadly, i don't have the free time required, and i'm currently trying to figure out if an issue i'm having is due to usb, btrfs, or the otg hub i'm using
16:53 < masterm_> hi?
18:09 < ohms360> steev, i'm strongly considering working on such a project as far as PPCel64 goes if I have enough people willing to contribute
18:31 < steev> ohms360: all that is really required is figuring out the build order (and of course fixing any issues with the non-Intel platforms); shouldn't be too much work, I just sadly don't have as much free time as I would like to dedicate to it
21:12 < brainy> hmmmmm
