15:35 < satu> So... i got one more question before I install?
15:36 < satu> Can I use Synaptic and Debian (Sid) repos too?
15:39 < liujianfeng> satu: deepin modified the sid repo, use deepin repo is better
15:39 < satu> I will, but extra apps? Those not in Store.
15:40 < satu> Like I now use AUR and Manjaros own repos.
15:45 < liujianfeng> satu: you can use synaptic to install apps not in store
15:46 < satu> Ok, thanks. That's all I wanted to know. :)
