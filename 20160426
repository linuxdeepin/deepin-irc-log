03:08 < mescon> has anybody been able to change the resolution in Manjaro Deepin? There is no "Done" or "OK" button after I change it.
03:08 < mescon> i guess the button is outside of the window somehow
03:08 < mescon> defaults to 800x600
03:19 < dance707> hi mescon there should be confirm button below the resolutions unless your running in a VB or something
03:19 < mescon> it doesnt show up though
03:19 < mescon> it does in Deepin 15.1.1 but not in Manjaro Deepin 16.03
03:21 < dance707> mescon my systems are all Deepin 15.1.1
03:22 < mescon> ah ok
03:22 < mescon> i was just trying out deepin 15.1.1 vs deepin manjaro
03:22 < mescon> haven't been a linux user since 2008 or so
03:22 < dance707> mescon but in a virtual machine either one will not show the confirm button
03:23 < mescon> well both are in virtual machines
03:23 < mescon> and in deepin 15.1.1 it works fine
03:24 < dance707> mescon virtual machine the VB handles the resolution
03:24 < mescon> using vmware
03:25 < mescon> but as I said, it shows up just fine in Deepin 15.1.1
03:25 < mescon> but not in manjaro deepin
03:25 < dance707> may be different there then I do see a apply button in my Deepin 15.1.1 in a VB
03:27 < dance707> mescon you might want to check the Manjaro channel as to why that is
03:28 < mescon> asked the exact same question over there
03:28 < mescon> got the standard eric s. raymond reply on how to ask a question, so i guess they are the same old elitist community I decided to leave behind
03:29 < dance707> mescon as far as the Deepin 15.1.1 they do recommend a real environment
03:29 < mescon> yep, i know
03:29 < mescon> but thanks for the help
03:29 < mescon> cheers dance707!
