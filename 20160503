02:40 < dance707> hi xcasex please define resume
05:44 < xcasex> resume on suspend, dance707
05:52 < dance707> xcasex on suspend if you press power button you be presented the login screen unless you disable password required to wake up in control center.
06:00 < dance707> xcasex what color blank screen where you getting ?
06:30 < xcasex> black w. backlight on, using fglrx, and there's no login screen. also, there's no cc setting for disabling that afaik
06:37 < dance707> xcasex The latest AMD drivers are not fully compatible. I have tested the Fglrx-15.302 and experienced the same thing. If you want to you disable in control center under power management and select a plan that does not suspend
06:40 < qih> Is there a CLI Music or Sound Player in Deepin Linux by default?
06:43 < dance707> xcasex also you should see the see the setting for password required to wake up in Power management but in your case selecting a plan other than power saver should not suspend after 15 mins
06:44 < dance707> hi qih not that I am aware of, there may be something in the repositories
06:45 < qih> dance707: K, is there an online listing of apps in the repo?
06:47 < dance707> qih there may be a listing in Debian not sure
06:47 < dance707> qih where you looking for something in paticular ?
06:47 < qih> Something like aplay, for use in sripting
06:47 < qih> scripting* even
06:48 < dance707> xcasex also if you read the Deepin Forum you may be aware of Deepins new up-and-coming new linux kernel plan
06:51 < dance707> qih alsaplayer is in the repositories
06:51 < qih> dance707: OK good, that'll do
06:52 < dance707> qih a good way to search is with synaptic
06:53 < qih> k, I use apt-get exclusively
06:53 < qih> But noted.
06:53 < dance707> qih ahh okay
06:54 < qih> I was thinking of jumping back to OpenBSD59 but I really like Deepin
06:56 < dance707> qih I run Deepin on my workstation and 4 pc's Really like the Debian base
06:57 < dance707> qih and of course there DDE with unique windows manager
07:01 < qih> yeah DDE is neat for sure, although I think the initial install is still a bit bloated
07:02 < dance707> qih a minimal install would be nice but they don't have one now
07:03 < qih> Fair enough
07:03 < qih> That's what I like about OpenBSD, Base, DM and that's it
07:03 < qih> But it is as ugly as fuck 8-)
07:04 < dance707> qih with the Debian package management its easy to remove default aps , unlike other systems
07:05 < qih> dance707: of course, just griping
07:23 < dance707> qih the average new user to Linux would feel lost if they did not see some of the default aps
07:23 < qih> Agree
23:39 < brainy> hi hualet
