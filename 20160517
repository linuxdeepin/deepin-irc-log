04:36 < makkon>  yyyeerbo -  respected and worthy person,  and had no idea that the topic is interesting to all!
04:47 < dance707d> makkon thank you. Keep in mind it is a Deepin Kernel plan with short term and mid-long term goals. Not so much version change as hardware compatibility and stability. As far as fresh player the sid version is 3.5-1 right now

05:09 < dance707d> hi arunpyasi its a "Deepin kernel Plan" not planned cureently 4.4.0-2 and testing 4.4.0-3 you can see more information about the Kernel Plan in the forum post

05:12 < dance707d> arunpyasi yes I think it is a god move. thugh rather controversial
05:13 < arunpyasi> dance707d: where you live BTW, I guess haven't seen you around. :P
