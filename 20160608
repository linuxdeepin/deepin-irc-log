08:22 < talonz> in deepin-music is there a way to sort by artist but keep the albums in order and track numbers in order ?
08:22 < talonz> at the moment if i sort by artist it randomises all the tracks by that artist
08:24 < talonz> never mind i found a solution
12:42 < steev> will there be an update for the nanopi deepin image?  if so, would it be possible to include the firmware for the brcm device on the fire?
