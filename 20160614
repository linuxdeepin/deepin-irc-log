11:35 < tuxhunter> hey can some one told me how longer will take to throw more updates?
11:40 < steev> tuxhunter: whenever there are some, they will be up
11:40 < steev> updates don't come just to churn cpu
11:42 < tuxhunter> i just want to know because i am in vacacion in USA and my place the internet is slow like a slime so thats the reason why i want to know how longer will take those updates steev
11:42 < tuxhunter> vacation*
11:43 < steev> tuxhunter: is there some specific update you're looking for/expecting?
11:43 < steev> afaik, deepin isn't based on testing, so updates don't roll in extremely fast, only when something is actually broken and needs fixing
11:43 < steev> based on debian testing*
11:46 < tuxhunter> no, just updates like the kernel,desktop,deepin store,etc... the only thing i am impressed in this distro is battery performance great performance but i will still recomend bettering up the battery performance just 20% more the performance
11:48 < tuxhunter> just 20%
11:51 < tuxhunter> steev
11:52 < tuxhunter> so i have to wait 2-6 months for updates steev
11:52 < steev> tuxhunter: those don't happen extremely often, so you'll probably be waiting a while (disclaimer: i'm not a dev, just someone who likes the desktop)
11:52 < tuxhunter> ok sorry steev
11:53 < steev> no need to apologize
11:53 < steev> just don't expect updates constantly :)
11:54 < tuxhunter> i know but its based on debian and debian distros are good polish so why this distro is doesn,t have that polish that it needed
11:54 < tuxhunter> steev
11:54 < steev> what do you mean doesn't have the polish?
11:54 < tuxhunter> or at least the polish enough
11:55 < tuxhunter> polish in sense of rock solid stable system
11:56 < steev> tuxhunter: give concrete examples; what isn't working for you, how is it unstable?  you say "20% more performance"; but that number is based on what?  are you running it on an atom netbook laptop or what?
11:58 < tuxhunter> on a lenovo thinkpad but the 20% thing is for those laptops not for my laptop my laptop hs a good battery performance
11:59 < tuxhunter> but for me is runnig fine just few bugs but not a big deal at least for me
11:59 < tuxhunter> but for other people is a big deal those bugs
12:00 < steev> tuxhunter: what other people?
12:00 < tuxhunter> linux noobs
12:00 < steev> you're literally the only person i've seen in here asking for updates
12:02 < tuxhunter> yeah jajaja and one thing what is the best video editor for linux?
12:05 < steev> i have no idea
12:05 < steev> i don't do video editing, sorry
12:05 < tuxhunter> steev which desktop or laptop are using right now?
12:06 < steev> tuxhunter: i run deepin on an old compaq of some sort (i'm not home right now don't recall the model), and on my nanopi2 and nanopi2 fire
12:07 < steev> the compaq is a laptop
12:07 < tuxhunter> ok if you are not a dev,you are a eingeneer,or what?
12:08 < steev> i work on Kali Linux which is another Debian derivative, and I'm working on bringing the deepin desktop to Kali
12:11 < tuxhunter> what 0.0 are you crazy you have to told the kali linux team "i will bring this desktop enviroment fixx al the bugs in the desktop and help linux deeping for fixing this issues jajaja" anyway my friend gots kali linux if i tols this my friend will be more happy than ever steev
12:12 < steev> tuxhunter: don't expect it soon, blackhat is coming up and that's the main focus right now, although i would *love* to debut it there
12:13 < tuxhunter> but Kali linux is a debian testing if you not change to the rolling release
12:13 < steev> tuxhunter: yes i know, i'm a kali dev, i'm familiar with what we're based on
12:14 < tuxhunter> wait wait wait you told me that you are not a dev
12:14 < steev> i'm not a deepin dev
12:15 < tuxhunter> ooh ok tht it explains it do you know python programming steev
12:15 < steev> some, although it's not my language of choice
12:17 < tuxhunter> ok i want to build a script for just asking question if the answers its good it will go to next one but it its wrong it will try again but not to the first question
12:20 < tuxhunter> for example:Question number5 what is 10 + 10? you answers is 22 try again but not starting the fist question steev and what is you language of choice steev
12:25 < tuxhunter> ok thanks for the help then
12:28 < tuxhunter> sorry for taking your time and bothering you
12:28 < tuxhunter> bye
