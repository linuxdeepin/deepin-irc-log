03:19 < TroniQ89> Hi. I created an unofficial french support channel for deepin : #deepin-fr
08:48 < JLye> This is my most popular Linux post. I've added to it a few times. Is there anything you think I missed ? http://golivelively.com/2016/02/02/deepin2015/
09:34 < LordDragon> anyone around in here?
09:58 < JLye> hi
09:58 < JLye> what is up, LordDragon ?
09:58 < LordDragon> just having a problem installing nvidia drivers
09:59 < LordDragon> i got the latest one installed
09:59 < LordDragon> but the mouse lags
09:59 < LordDragon> and the desktop bakground flickers
09:59 < LordDragon> like something is really messed up with the driver
10:00 < JLye> I'd suggest asking in #Nvidia freenode channel. This room seems extremely dead. I can't help you much more than that
10:00 < JLye> Sorry
10:00 < LordDragon> yeah problem is they are gonna support common distros
10:00 < LordDragon> not obscure custom linux distros like deepin
10:01 < LordDragon> i dont know if they can help me with this
10:01 < JLye> best to try and know than assume and disregard
23:08 < brainy> hi Marqin
