00:55 < grief> So I've got a question about "deepin-notifications". I'm running openbox and when I use it there's a non-transparent background for it. I'm using compton, is there any way to add complete transparency?
03:36 < arunpyasi> hi grief
03:36 < grief> hi arunpyasi
03:47 < arunpyasi> you use Deepin ?
04:56 < grief> no, I am using openbox
04:56 < grief> But I like how deepin notifications look
07:19 < arunpyasi> grief, great ! :)
07:19 < arunpyasi> You been here from a while ?
07:22 < grief> what?

07:58 < grief> well I have been here fror a few hours
07:58 < grief> so
07:58 < grief> sorry for the late reply
08:00 < arunpyasi> grief, no worries
08:00 < grief> well, do you know what the name is that I can put into compton?
08:00 < arunpyasi> If you like Deepin and wanna help or support Deepin people, would like you to stay here :D
08:00 < grief> or is there a way to configure it?
08:00 < arunpyasi> I mean add this channel as auto join :P
08:00 < arunpyasi> compton??
08:01 < grief> I don't even have my regular channels on any kind of auto-join
08:01 < grief> compton is a composition manager
08:01 < arunpyasi> Ohh, no idea :D
08:01 < arunpyasi> BTW, grief gotta go for short sleep now
