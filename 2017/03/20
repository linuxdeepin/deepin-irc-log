04:41 < arunpyasi> hi jaffee
04:41 < arunpyasi> jaffee, fixed it ?
04:54 < jaffee> arunpyasi, nope (
18:30 < scootergrisen> deepin-image-viewer have been added til transifex to translate but why do i need to translate the exact same string multiple times. This could be done better by resusing the strings
18:31 < scootergrisen> "Fullscreen" appear 5 times. "Cancel" 4 times. "OK" 2 times. "Delete" 4 times. "Add" 3 times.
18:32 < scootergrisen> Names like "Deepin Image Viewer" could be translated one place and then use %s placeholder to reuse it
