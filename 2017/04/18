00:03 < manshi10> Hi
00:05 < manshi10> I actually wanted help, I am trying to clone and install the dde-file-manager repository on my system. While running qmake .. it gives me an error, "dtkutil", "dtkbase" not found. How do I download these packages? I am sorry if this seems like a silly question, but I'm new to GitHub.
