04:56 < GabrielM_> hi
04:57 < GabrielM_> Does anyone know the Deepin 15.04 translation link?
14:51 < berz3rk> Hello
14:51 < berz3rk> China ^^
14:51 < berz3rk> I want to translate the Deepin Website, the problem is, it seems you can't translate the english version as well
14:52 < berz3rk> But it has a lot of spelling problems
14:52 < berz3rk> also the news have grammar issues
14:52 < berz3rk> I saw this
14:52 < berz3rk> https://www.transifex.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-website/
14:54 < berz3rk> I have a lot to criticize about deepin, how the news are made, how bugs are reported and more

16:18 < berz3rk123> hey, I cant install nvidia-driver , can you help? ...
20:18 < gotwig_work> Hey there
20:19 < gotwig_work> I tried to use Deepin 15.4 with proprietary drivers but it failed pretty hard because of some dependendies
20:19 < gotwig_work> with Xorg
20:19 < gotwig_work> does anyone know about this? it was a pretty frustrating experience. + the default niveau or shipped intel drivers show a lot of broken fragments where blur occurs all over dock and right sidebar
20:20 < gotwig_work> *Nvidia
20:33 < gotwig_work> no one here?
20:33 < gotwig_work> arunpyasi: hey
20:34 < gotwig_work> dardevelin: hi
20:34 < gotwig_work> RyanOrz:  hello
21:04 < brainy> hi Xceals
21:11 < gotwig_work> brainy: oh someone is there :D?
21:11 < gotwig_work> o.0 i waited here for like hours
21:11 < brainy> lol gotwig_work
21:11 < gotwig_work> no chance a dev comes by..?
21:11 < arunpyasi> hi gotwig_work
21:11 < brainy> that's normal here :D
21:11 < arunpyasi> hey brainy
21:11 < brainy> hey arunpyasi big bro
21:11 < gotwig_work> So I checked out the newest release and its realy great progress
21:12 < brainy> you mean the beta?
21:12 < gotwig_work> apps fit very well together, its a brilliant experience
21:12 < arunpyasi> how are you brainy ?
21:12 < gotwig_work> 15.4
21:12 < gotwig_work> the RC
21:12 < idoko> gotwig_work I'm here because I'm downloading it now :D
21:12 < arunpyasi> no hualet at this time too :P
21:12 < gotwig_work> but I still got issues
21:12 < arunpyasi> gotwig_work, are you new guy around ?
21:12 < arunpyasi> :P
21:12 < gotwig_work> the nvidia driver was a dealbreaker ;'(
21:12 < arunpyasi> Our #Deepin channel looks good today
21:12 < idoko> any chance of something like an album view coming to deepin-music?
21:12 < arunpyasi> many people around :D
21:12 < brainy> gotwig_work: I had lots of issues too
21:12 < gotwig_work> I follow deepin linux progress already for several years
21:13 < gotwig_work> im not using it right now because of big issues with drivers
21:13 < gotwig_work> what is so sad, because I tried to use it as my work os at work
21:13 < gotwig_work> also the drivers are more outdated then for example in ubuntu 17.04
21:13 < gotwig_work> what a bummer
21:14 < gotwig_work> ubuntu ships with 375, deepin 15.4 driver install tool can install 36x something in theory, but it even fails then
21:15 < brainy> yeah
21:15 < brainy> i really like it but too many issues
21:15 < brainy> some minor some major
21:16 < gotwig_work> I worked for elementary OS several years ago
21:16 < gotwig_work> I hope I can find time and the opportunity to help deepin grow bigger
21:16 < gotwig_work> especialy the english websites
21:16 < gotwig_work> and the translations
21:16 < gotwig_work> are just plain horrible
21:16 < gotwig_work> the news section
21:17 < brainy> that would be grat
21:17 < gotwig_work> just pick some random news article and you will find like 40% spelling mistakes
21:17 < gotwig_work> i dont want to be rude at all
21:17 < gotwig_work> but I say theres a lot of room for improvement
21:17 < brainy> you should contact hualet
21:17 < gotwig_work> brainy: do you work for deepin technology?
21:17 < brainy> havent seen him for a while but usually he is one of the devs who is always online
21:18 < brainy> no i dont gotwig_work , just a regular user
21:18 < gotwig_work> ah ok
21:18 < gotwig_work> quite often its the same across new distros: they try experimental stuff, dont test software good enough, and then they ship a lot of broken things
21:18 < gotwig_work> its not as smooth as ubuntu or other distros
21:19 < gotwig_work> RC means to me its almost the thing meant for prime time
21:19 < gotwig_work> but if even the nvidia driver cant be installed, thats a big deal breaker ;(
21:20 < gotwig_work> if deepin wants to suceed, all default pages should be english in the first place, not chinese
21:21 < brainy> i agree with you
21:21 < brainy> arunpyasi was also not so happy with it
21:22 < gotwig_work> and the package management in linux makes me so sad...
21:22 < gotwig_work> brainy: do you know if theres any chance they ship some day deepin with proprietary drivers preinstalled?
21:22 < gotwig_work> because most of the time preinstalled stuff cant break
21:23 < gotwig_work> modern nvidia drivers are modular, so you can install them, and they are not in conflict with other packages
21:23 < brainy> hmmm really I cant tell gotwig_work , we need to ask some of the devs :/
21:23 < gotwig_work> :x
21:23 < gotwig_work> yeah
21:32  * gotwig_work is back
21:33 < brainy> hi gotwig_work :D

21:57 < gotwig_work> theres a lot of social help from the government
21:57 < gotwig_work> but that doesnt apply to foreigners
21:57 < gotwig_work> the most "kids" i study with @ university get sponsored by their rich parents :D xD
22:00 < gotwig_work> arunpyasi: in which sector do you want to work
