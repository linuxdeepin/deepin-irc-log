03:57 < brainy> I like Windows 7 theme so far, loool
03:57 < arunpyasi> brainy, Deepin after moved to Debian
03:57 < brainy> ahh ok
03:57 < arunpyasi> they are like completely isolated
03:57 < arunpyasi> and people haven't made its fork for ubuntu or mint :P
03:57 < brainy> why every distro first start with ubuntu and then they move away
03:58 < arunpyasi> brainy, it depends bro..
03:58 < brainy> whyyyy bro
03:58 < arunpyasi> brainy, Because Ubuntu is known to many people.. Its popular due to Cannonical supporting it
03:58 < arunpyasi> many Laptop/Servers come with Ubuntu preinstalled
03:59 < arunpyasi> and on popularity, they rise.. the binary packages are found more for Ubuntu.
03:59 < arunpyasi> and why they move is because they are done with Ubuntu and wanna try other distros :D
03:59 < brainy> lolz
04:00 < arunpyasi> brainy, I personally found Ubuntu 16.04 fine for me and my work, is stable.. I change the looks sometime to get new feel and fresh :D
