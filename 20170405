04:22 < arunpyas-> <arunpyas-> brainy, are different respect to place.
04:22 < arunpyas-> <arunpyas-> brainy, some foods may be same.
04:22 < arunpyas-> <arunpyas-> brainy, here in Nepal, though its small, food depends on where you live and what culture you follow
04:22 < arunpyas-> <arunpyas-> but the common food is rice, lentils and a veges or meat..

04:23 < arunpyas-> hehe
04:23 < brainy_> yeah but website no updates and slooow
04:23 < brainy_> and here?? no support ever
04:23 < arunpyas-> brainy_, this IRC channel is very inactive
04:23 < brainy_> no devs online
04:23 < arunpyas-> brainy_, no officials.
04:23 < arunpyas-> yeah

04:23 < arunpyas-> brainy_, and also there are very few people coming here.
04:24 < brainy_> yep
04:25 < brainy> as i said 10 years ago, there should be a shortcut on fresh deepin install, on desktop, to this IRC channel
04:25 < brainy> but nobody listen to me :D
04:25 < brainy> arunpyas-:
04:25 < arunpyas-> brainy, totally agree on you bro.
04:26 < arunpyas-> brainy, but may be deepin people were focusing on business support than IRC support.
04:31 < brainy> arunpyas-: hmm i see
04:31 < brainy> so they focus on companies instead of normal people
04:31 < arunpyas-> brainy, hmm
04:31 < brainy> makes sense
