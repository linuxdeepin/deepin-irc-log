22:35 < deepinfreeze> i am causing a deepin freeze with rightclick on a dock icon - also dde-control-center does not work when moving the mouse to the appropiate hot corner - deepin is installed on top of a fresh installed archlinux on two machines with intel only gfx driver and the other machine with nvidia - same effect. Could somebody help ?
