03:58 < MarekBujko> Hello, why is Deepin 15.4 unstable release? Final ISO have Readme.dis with: Deepin 15.4 "unstable".
04:00 < MarekBujko> Why is Deepin OS 15.4 and Installer still untranslated in Slovak and other 100% translated languages? Deepin is in Slovak language on Transifex 98-100% translated 1-2 weeks. In new Final ISO is Slovak installer 30% and system on 90% translated only.  Only 5 languages (practicaly 6) are on Transifex 100% translated: English, Chinese, Slovak, Italian, Malay and Spanish (Latin America).
10:31 < brainy> hi vodcod
10:45 < brainy> vodcod is the best, no doubt
10:55 < vodcod> sup brainy
10:55 < vodcod> hows it going
10:55 < brainy> fine thx vodcod
10:55 < brainy> is the new deepin out yet?
10:57 < vodcod> I have no real idea hah
10:59 < brainy> ok :D
11:03 < brainy> well it seems to have been released today
11:04 < brainy> vodcod: you were using elementary OS right?
11:12 < vodcod> well, I did
11:12 < vodcod> but I run mint
11:12 < vodcod> I cant stand EOS
11:13 < brainy> vodcod: okies
11:14 < brainy> i'm running mint as well
11:16 < vodcod> yeah
11:23 < deepin-bot> [somebody]: MarekBujko, yes, there are some languages in deepin 15.4 not 100%
11:26 < brainy> ok
11:27 < deepin-bot> [somebody]: MarekBujko,We updated many English source files before release, so the translators in 32 languages don't have enought time to translate all source files and we also don't have enought time to buy translatios from transifex. Till the release of deepin15.4, not all the translations are 100％ in Deepin aplications and system, but we have to release all 32 languges, so that's what you see, the interface in many applications is English.   Reall
11:27 < deepin-bot> isuue in next version and also welcome all of you to join transifex to help us translate your local language.
11:49 < brainy> Thanks for the info, deepin-bot
