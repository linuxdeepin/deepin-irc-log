00:16 < brainy> hi deepin-bot
00:34 < niceguy> hi people
00:34 < niceguy> anyone here?
01:09 < brainy> hi niceguy
01:10 < brainy> niceguy: people here are usually very quiet :(
01:12 < brainy> I'm watching Al Bundy episodes now
01:40 < niceguy> brainy: I agree :D
01:42 < niceguy> are you guys aware of 15.4 release ?
01:44 < brainy> niceguy: yep, it's out
01:44 < niceguy> Yeah, it finally is.
01:44 < brainy> whats your take on it ??
01:45 < brainy> you like it niceguy ?
01:46 < niceguy> I am still for mine (15.3) to upgrade.
01:46 < brainy> Okay
01:46 < niceguy> Screenchots look nice though.
01:46 < niceguy> I think I am gonna like it.
01:49 < brainy> That's great to hear man
01:50 < brainy> but in my opinion the control center could have more tweaking options
01:50 < brainy> Mint's control center is "bigger"
01:50 < brainy> as an example
02:03 < brainy> hi deepin-ilbot
06:53 < CountryfiedLinux> howdy
06:53 < CountryfiedLinux> I wanna install Deepin 15.4 but the download mirrors are so slow.
06:54 < CountryfiedLinux> Can someone please speed up the download mirrors so I can install Deepin? It looks so nice!
10:38 < brainy> I wanna make one thing clear here, and that is that I like you all.
10:39 < brainy> Whether you use deepin or Ubuntu or even Whindoze(tm)
10:42 < brainy> I remember a Chinese distro YLMF OS, it looked exactly like Windows XP.

23:51 < felixonmars> hi brainy
23:52 < brainy> felixonmars: I saw a feature in Deepin
23:52 < brainy> when you right-click on an app in the menu, you can directly de-install the app from there
23:53 < brainy> I made that suggestion long time ago, I wonder if it was my idea they implemented :D
23:53 < brainy> Would make me happy
